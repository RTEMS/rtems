/*  timer.c
 *
 *  This file manages the benchmark timer used by the RTEMS Timing Test

 *  benchmark_timer_initialize() and benchmark_timer_read().  benchmark_timer_read() usually returns
 *  the number of microseconds since benchmark_timer_initialize() exitted.
 *
 *  NOTE: It is important that the timer start/stop overhead be
 *        determined when porting or modifying this code.
