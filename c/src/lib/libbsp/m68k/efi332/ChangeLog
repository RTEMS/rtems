2001-05-26	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in: Add bspopts.h.
	* include/.cvsignore: Add bspopts.h*, stamp-h*.
	* include/Makefile.am: Use *_HEADERS instead of *H_FILES.
	* include/bsp.h: Include bspopts.h.

2001-05-10	Ralf Corsepius	<corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in: Use RTEMS_PROG_CC_FOR_TARGET([-ansi -fasm]).

2000-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use ... instead of RTEMS_TOPdir in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.

2000-11-02	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Switch to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/aclocal.

2000-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,
	and libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and
	now must be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order
	was cleaned up while doing this.

2000-10-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros.
        Switch to GNU canonicalization.

2000-10-12	John S Gwynne <jgwynne@mrcday.com>

	* start/start.c: Modified to support generation of ram_init.
	* start/ram_init.ld, BSP/start/ram_init.sed: New files.
	These changes enable RTEMS to automatically generate
	the ram_init file used by gdb with the BDM patches. The 332 has
	on-board chip select lines (for RAM and FLASH) that must be
	configured before use of these peripherals. These patches parse
	data from start.c where the chip select lines are configured in
	the runtime executable and automatically generates the gdb
	initialization file using the same settings. A great time saver.
	A similar file, ram_init_FW (flash writable), is also generated
	that the flash programming tool uses.
	* start/Makefile.am: Modified to support above.
	* CPU/sim.h: Modified to support above.
	* startup/except_vect_332_ROM.S: Moved to start so it would not
	be included in libbsp.a.  Moving it to start ensures it is
	available as a single object file.
	* start/except_vect_332_ROM.S: Moved from startup.
	* startup/linkcmds, startup/linkcmds_ROM: Fixes to the memory map
	shown in the comments.

2000-09-29	Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* startup/linkcmds: Added lines so DWARF debug information
	would be available.  Otherwise gdb complains that the offsets
	for the debug info are incorrect and doesn't load the files.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* clock/Makefile.am, console/Makefile.am, spurious/Makefile.am,
	start/Makefile.am, startup/Makefile.am, timer/Makefile.am,
	wrapup/Makefile.am: Include compile.am

2000-08-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog: New file.
