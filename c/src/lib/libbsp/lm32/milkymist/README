This is a BSP written by Yann Sionneau <yann.sionneau@telecom-sudparis.eu>
as part of Google Summer of Code 2010.

This is a BSP to make RTEMS run on Milkymist One board using Milkymist SoC

It provides driver for timer, uart, ethernet, framebuffer so far.

Milkymist SoC is running @ 83 MHz with 128 MB of 32-bit DDR400 SDRAM
The SoC is based on a XC6SLX45 Spartan-6 FPGA running 
the LatticeMico32 softcore.

Milkymist is a project leaded by Sebastien Bourdeauducq (aka lekernel)
