2010-05-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	BSPs. Now those which were directly copied are shared.
	* startup/usc.S: New file.
	* liblnk/lnklib.S, liblnk/pmon.S, liblnk/regs.h, startup/idtmem.S,
	startup/idttlb.S: Removed.

2010-05-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: rbtx4925, rbtx4938, and hurricane had very
	similar versions of exception. Now all use shared/irq/exception.S
	* startup/exception.S: Removed.

2010-05-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	section where it was present.

2010-04-25	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrilL@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add NOLOAD to .bss to eliminate warnings.

	* configure.ac: Remove RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS.

 2009-07-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* configure.ac: Rename BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS to
	RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS. Add RTEMS_BSP_CLEANUP_OPTIONS so all BSPs
	have the same options.

2009-04-28	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* start/start.S: Update for boot_card command line change.

2009-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1385/cpukit
	* startup/exception.S: When the type rtems_boolean was switched to the
	C99 bool, the size changed from 4 bytes to 1 byte. The interrupt
	dispatching code accesses two boolean variables for scheduling
	purposes and the assembly implementations of this code did not get
	updated.

2008-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* bsp_specs: Move -e start from *link to *startfile to avoid warning

	of building libbspstart.a, using automake-rules.

2008-09-29	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* liblnk/regs.S: Remove (Renamed into liblnk/regs.h).

	BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS.

2008-09-23	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* start/start.S: bsp_cleanup() had the same code which was executed
	when you returned from boot_card() to start.S. So just use the stub
	bsp_cleanup() implementation and remove a file.
	* startup/bspclean.c: Removed.

2008-09-19	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Eliminate tm27 items from bsp.h

2008-09-18	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Remove unnecessary boilerplate comments.

2008-09-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	bsp_get_work_area() implementation.
	* startup/bspgetworkarea.c: Removed.

2008-09-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* clock/ckinit.c, startup/bspstart.c: Remove unnecessary includes of
	rtems/libcsupport.h and rtems/libio.h.

2008-09-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, startup/bspstart.c: Split out
	bsp_get_work_area() into its own file and user BSP Framework to
	perform more initialization.
	* startup/bspgetworkarea.c: New file.

2008-09-05	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/ckinit.c: The Shared Memory Driver no longer requires the
	special IOCTL in Clock_control. This was a hack which has existed
	since before the Classic API Timer Manager was implemented. All
	implementations of and references to Clock_control were removed.

2008-09-05	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* console/console.c: Convert to "bool".

2008-05-15	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Add capability for bootcard.c BSP Initialization
	Framework to ask the BSP where it has memory for the RTEMS Workspace
	and C Program Heap. These collectively are referred to as work area.
	If the BSP supports this, then it does not have to include code to
	split the available memory between the two areas. This reduces the
	amount of code in the BSP specific bspstart.c file. Additionally, the
	shared framework can initialize the C Library, call
	rtems_debug_enable(), and dirty the work area memory. Until most/all
	BSPs support this new capability, if the BSP supports this, it should
	call RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_HANDLES_RAM_ALLOCATION from its configure.ac.
	When the transition is complete, this autoconf macro can be removed.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed initialization routines to
	rtems_initialize_data_structures, rtems_initialize_before_drivers,
	rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-11-26	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* clock/ckinit.c, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate the
	clicks_per_microsecond field in the MIPS CPU Table and define another
	mechanism for drivers to obtain this information.

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-04-09	Ralf Corsépius	<ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove --oformat=... 
	Use old_link for -qrtems (Prevents *.link from killing endianness).

2007-04-06	Ralf Corsépius	<ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove lib (Now expected to exist in GCC).

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/ckinit.c, startup/exception.S: Correct license URL and/or fix
	mistake in copyright notice. Both of these mistakes appear to be from
	code submitted after these changes were made previously.

2007-03-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1227/bsps
	* include/bsp.h: Remove MAX_LONG_TEST_DURATION and
	MAX_SHORT_TEST_DURATION. They are obsolete and unused.

2006-12-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* include/bsp.h: Use uint32_t instead of unsigned32.

2006-12-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	file and simplified initialization.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>
