	* pc386/console/console.c, pc386/console/serial_mouse.c,
	pc386/console/vgainit.c, shared/comm/tty_drv.c: Remove warnings.

2000-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use ... instead of RTEMS_TOPdir in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.

2000-11-02	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Switch to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/aclocal.

2000-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,
	and libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and
	now must be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order
	was cleaned up while doing this.

2000-10-29	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/sbrk.c: Removed.  Redundant with shared version.

2000-10-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros.
        Switch to GNU canonicalization.

	* console/serial_mouse.c: Fixed typos introduced by removal of CR/LF.

2000-10-20	Rosimildo da Silva <rdasilva@connecttel.com>

	* console/serial_mouse.c: Added support for changing serial parameters.

2000-10-20	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/wd80x3.h: Added file header and logic to prevent multiple
	inclusions of this file.
	* wd8003/wd8003.c: Corrected attach to include "int attach" parameter.

2000-10-20	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Cleaned up network driver name and attach defines.

2000-10-20	Dmitry Kargapolov <dk@gentex.ru>

	* ne2000/ne2000.c: Fix some errors in the driver.  
	1. There was no sufficient check of data in ethernet header.
	The code in ne_rx_daemon() was:
            inport_word (dport, len);
	    ...
	    len -= 4;
	      ...
	    if (len > 0)
	      ne_read_data (sc, startaddr, len, p);
	Unfortunately, sometimes my NIC gave me too big len value,
	the result was memory override.  To fix this, I added ethernet
	header data checking.

	2. The way overrides were serviced was not good.  It was complex
	but sometimes did not provide reliable continuing of NIC working.
	I had the situation of an endless loop in ne_check_status()
	after override processing.

	3. There was conceptual error of porting.  The old method of
	overrides curing was ported from the OS-s, where override-processing
	did start immediately.  But RTEMS-version uses events, and cleaning
	of the overrides can start later.

	I selected the way of ne2000 programming that is used
	in freebsd kernel (v4.0).

	Because of both problems, incorrect data in header of raw packet
	and receiver override, it went through ne_reset() and fully
	reset the ne2000.

	So, in summary
	- added detecting of the incorrect data in ethernet header;
	- replaced handling of receiver overrides with new scheme,
	via resetting of NIC, this method is used also in case of
	invalid header detecting.

2000-10-18	 Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* console/console.c, console/serial_mouse.c, include/bsp.h:
	Add the ability to set parity, number of data bits and
	number of stop bits to the existing i386 serial drivers.

2000-10-17	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/Makefile.am: Added idt.c since it has been moved libcpu/i386
	to libbsp/i386/shared/irq.

2000-09-29	Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* startup/linkcmds: Added lines so DWARF debug information
	would be available.  Otherwise gdb complains that the offsets
	for the debug info are incorrect and doesn't load the files.

2000-09-11      Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* start/Makefile.am: Remove AM_CPPFLAGS and GAS_CODE16 conditional.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* 3c509/Makefile.am, clock/Makefile.am, console/Makefile.am,
	ne2000/Makefile.am, start/Makefile.am, startup/Makefile.am,
	timer/Makefile.am, wd8003/Makefile.am, wrapup/Makefile.am: Include
	compile.am

	to static inline.
