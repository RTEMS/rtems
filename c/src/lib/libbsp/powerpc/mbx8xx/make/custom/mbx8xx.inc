#  This section makes the target dependent options file.
#
#  Note that RTEMS_BSP matches the RTEMS_MBX_MODEL. Its value must be
#  defined in targopts.h, so the few places that require different code
#  for different MBX models can be distinguished. The value of
#  RTEMS_BSP is already defined in targopts.h and is one of:
#     mbx860_001    mbx821_001
#     mbx860_002    mbx821_002
#     mbx860_003    mbx821_003
#     mbx860_004    mbx821_004
#     mbx860_005    mbx821_005
#     mbx860_001b   mbx821_001b
#     mbx860_002b   mbx821_002b
#     mbx860_003b   mbx821_003b
#     mbx860_004b   mbx821_004b
#     mbx860_005b   mbx821_005b
#     mbx860_006b   mbx821_006b

#  The specific CPU model is defined, so the few places that require
#  different code for the MPC860 and MPC821 can be distinguished.
#  Either mpc860 or mpc821 is defined.

#  This contains the compiler options necessary to select the CPU model
