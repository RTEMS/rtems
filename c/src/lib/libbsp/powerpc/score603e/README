Notes
=====

This BSP has been tested using any Rom monitor.  There have
been three rom chips loaded on the boards.  One with the SDS
debug monitor, one with the firmworks monitor, and one with
the OAR Boot chip.  The OAR Boot chip contains the basic 
initialization from the SDS debugger and a jump to flash
location 0x04001200.

The compiler option SCORE603E_GENERATION is set to 1 or 2,
for the generation to be produced.
