Board description
-----------------
clock rate:	234 MHz
ROM:		16MByte FLASH
RAM:		64MByte DRAM

Virtex only supports single processor operations.

Configuration
-------------

This board support package is written for a typical virtex/PPC FPGA
system. The rough features of such a board are described above.

When a new virtex FPGA system is created (using the Xilinx design
software), a parameter file "xparameters.h" is also created, which
describes the basic features of the hardware (like peripherals
included, interrupt routing etc.).

This BSP normally takes its basic HW description for the file
"xparameters_dflt.h", which describes my FPGA system. When this BSP
should run on a different hardware, a path to the proper
"xparameters.h" can be provided on the "configure" command line.

For adapting this BSP to other boards, you can specify several configuration
options at the configure command line (use "./configure --help" in this
directory).  Here is an example for the top-level configure invocation:

/path/to/rtems/sources/configure \
  --target=powerpc-rtems4.11 \
  --enable-rtemsbsp=virtex \
  --enable-maintainer-mode \
  --enable-posix \
  --enable-tests \
  --disable-networking \
  'RTEMS_XPARAMETERS_H="/path/to/xparameters.h"' \
  VIRTEX_RAM_ORIGIN=0xfffc0000 \
  VIRTEX_RAM_LENGTH=0x3ffec \
  VIRTEX_RESET_ORIGIN=0xffffffec
