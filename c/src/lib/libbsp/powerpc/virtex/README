Board description
-----------------
clock rate:	234 MHz
ROM:		16MByte FLASH
RAM:		64MByte DRAM

virtex only supports single processor operations.

Porting
-------
This board support package is written for a typical virtex/PPC FPGA
system. The rough features of such a board are described above.

When a new virtex FPGA system is created (using the Xilinx design
software), a parameter file "xparameters.h" is also created, which
describes the basic features of the hardware (like peripherals
inculded, interrupt routing etc).

This BSP normally takes its basic HW description for the file
"xparameters_dflt.h", which describes my FPGA system. When this BSP
should run on a different hardware, a path to the proper
"xparameters.h" can be provided on the "configure" command line.

For adapting this BSP to other boards, 

the following files should be
modified:

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/virtex/startup/linkcmds
	for the memory layout required

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/virtex/startup/bspstart.c
	Here you can select the clock source for the timers and the
        serial interface (system clock or external clock pin), the clock
        rates, initial baud rate and other stuff

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/virtex/include/bsp.h
	some BSP-related constants

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/virtex/*
	well, they should be generic, so there _should_ be no reason
	to mess around there (but who knows...)
