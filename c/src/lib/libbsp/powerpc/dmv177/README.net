Setting the Ethernet Hardware Address
=====================================

The hardware Ethernet address is not set at the factory.  It is the
responsibility of the end-user to insure that it is set properly.
This file describes the standard procedure recommended by DY-4 
technical support for setting this address.  This procedure is 
similar to that followed by VxWorks as documented in DY-4
Document Number #807885.

The hardware Ethernet address and OS configuration information
must be stored in the SEEPROM non-volatile memory of the
SVME/DMV-176/177. The Foundation Firmware (FFW) reserves the 
first 256 bytes of the SEEPROM for its own use and the remaining
remaining 256 bytes are available for OS specific information.

Three bytes in the Serial EEPROM are used for the lowest three bytes
of the hardware Ethernet address These should be set to the serial
number of your SVME/DMV-176/177 card to ensure a unique Ethernet
address on your network. The three high bytes are hard coded in the
BSP and represent the vendor-specific Ethernet codes (0x00, 0x80, 0x7F).
Together these six bytes form the target's Ethernet address.

Address is of the form ...

NOTE: The serial number is found on the packaging (box) that the
board came in OR it is also located on the solder side of the board  and
looks something like SERNO:XXXXXX.  It can not be determined dynamically
by software.

Prior to using the Ethernet controller on the SVME/DMV-176/177 for the
first time, the Ethernet address bytes must be programmed into the
Serial EEPROM on the target card.   The 'emm' (EEPROM Memory Modification)
command in the General Purpose Monitor (GPM) can be used to do this.

In this example we will assume that the serial number of the target card
is 123456.
