Board description
-----------------
clock rate:   25 MHz
bus width:    8-bit PROM, 32-bit DRAM
ROM:          Up to 512KByte (Am29F040), 90 nsec chip select 0
RAM:          4 to 32 MByte DRAM SIMM (autodetect), 70 nsec,
              no parity, at CS7 or CS6+CS7 (for two-bank-SIMMs)


helas403 only supports single processor operations.

Porting
-------
This board support package is written for a typical PPC403GA
system. The rough features of this board are described above.

This BSP contains files for two startup methods:
- Direct start from Flash after powerup (with code run out of flash):
  This is the default configuration, it uses the files
    flashentry/flashentry.s
    startup/linkcmds

 Please note, that this configuration is good to startup the system,
but it will not gain maximum performance due to slow Flash access (8
bit wide only)

- Start after software download into DRAM:
  This configuration will use:
    dlentry/dlentry.s
    startup/linkcmds.dl

If you want to use the download configuration, it is sufficient to
rename the file "startup/linkcmds.dl" to "startup/linkcmds", it will
automatically reference the dlentry.s as entry code. (Renaming is not
quite elegant, a more sophisticated solution will follow in future,
any hints welcome ;-)

For adapting this BSP to other boards, the following files should be
modified:

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/flashentry/flashentry.s
        for the memory controller configuration and other basic stuff

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/startup/linkcmds[.dl]
        for the memory layout required

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/startup/bspstart.c
        Here you can select the clock source for the timers and the serial
        interface (system clock or external clock pin), the clock rates,
        initial baud rate and other stuff

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/include/bsp.h
        some BSP-related constants

The actual drivers are placed in 
- c/src/lib/libcpu/powerpc/ppc403/*
        well, they should be generic, so there _should_ be no reason
        to mess around there (but who knows...)
