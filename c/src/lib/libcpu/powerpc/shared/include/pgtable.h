/*
 * The PowerPC MMU uses a hash table containing PTEs, together with
 * a set of 16 segment registers (on 32-bit implementations), to define
 * the virtual to physical address mapping.
 *
 * We use the hash table as an extended TLB, i.e. a cache of currently
 * active mappings.  We maintain a two-level page table tree, much like
 * that used by the i386, for the sake of the Linux memory management code.
 * Low-level assembler code in head.S (procedure hash_page) is responsible
 * for extracting ptes from the tree and putting them into the hash table
 * when necessary, and updating the accessed and modified bits in the
 * page table tree.
 *
 * The PowerPC MPC8xx uses a TLB with hardware assisted, software tablewalk.
 * We also use the two level tables, but we can put the real bits in them
 * needed for the TLB and tablewalk.  These definitions require Mx_CTR.PPM = 0,
 * Mx_CTR.PPCS = 0, and MD_CTR.TWAM = 1.  The level 2 descriptor has
 * additional page protection (when Mx_CTR.PPCS = 1) that allows TLB hit
 * based upon user/super access.  The TLB does not have accessed nor write
 * protect.  We assume that if the TLB get loaded with an entry it is
 * accessed, and overload the changed bit for write protect.  We use
 * two bits in the software pte that are supposed to be set to zero in
 * the TLB entry (24 and 25) for these indicators.  Although the level 1
 * descriptor contains the guarded and writethrough/copyback bits, we can
 * set these at the page level since they get copied from the Mx_TWC
 * register when the TLB entry is loaded.  We will use bit 27 for guard, since
 * that is where it exists in the MD_TWC, and bit 26 for writethrough.
 * These will get masked from the level 2 descriptor at TLB load time, and
 * copied to the MD_TWC before it gets loaded.

 * The vmalloc() routines leaves a hole of 4kB between each vmalloced
 * area for the same reason. ;)

 * We no longer map larger than phys RAM with the BATs so we don't have
 * to worry about the VMALLOC_OFFSET causing problems.  We do have to worry
 * about clashes between our early calls to ioremap() that start growing down
 * from ioremap_base being run into the VM area allocations (growing upwards
 * from VMALLOC_START).  For this reason we have ioremap_bot to check when
 * we actually run into our mappings setup in the early boot with the VM
 * system.  This really does become a problem for machines with good amounts
 * of RAM.  -- Cort
