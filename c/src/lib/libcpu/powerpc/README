This hierarchy contains support routines for some of
the varied and quite numerous PowerPC processors
available from IBM and Motorola.

Since these routines can differ amongst different members
of the PowerPC family, an entry per CPU type is provided.

Initially, (4/December/1995), only the PPC403 was supported.
At this time, support is included for the following PowerPC
family members:

  + mpc505
  + mpc750
  + mpc821
  + mpc860
  + ppc403
  + mpc8260

Note that because of similarities in various family members,
the mpc823 should be able to use the mpc821 code and the
mpc850 should be able to use the mpc850 code.
