This hierarchy contains support routines for the Analog Devices
Blackfin family of processors.

It is assumed that bsp.h includes <libcpu/bfxxx.h>, where xxx is
the processor type.  This is how the libcpu modules determine which
processor variant they're being built for.

serial/spi* and serial/sport* are currently just placeholders.
serial/twi* does not contain enough code to do anything useful;
it is however a start at an I2C driver.
