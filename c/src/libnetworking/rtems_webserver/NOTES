Notes on merging GoAhead Webs 2.1.4.  Eventually RTEMS should be supported
in their distributions and this directory removed.

Applied patch from Antti P Miettinen <antti.p.miettinen@nokia.com>.

Obtain the original distribution from http://www.goahead.com for
documentation.

Porting

 - following source files are distributed with the web server
