This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: itrontask04

directives:
  chg_pri cre_tsk dis_dsp ena_dsp exd_tsk frsm_tsk rot_rdq rsm_tsk 
  sta_tsk sus_tsk

concepts: 

  a.  This test check task suspend and resume functionality.
  
  b.  Verifies the suspend count works correctly.

  c.  Verifies the forced resume works correctly

  d.  Verifies the rotate ready queue works correctly

  e.  Verifies a task called with rtems suspend can be resumed 
      with an itron resume call. ( XXX - May not be necessary. )

  f.  verifies rot_rdq can be used by non-equal priority tasks to correctly rotate ready queue.

  g.  Verifies enable dispatch and disable dispatch work.

notes: 

  This verision of ITRON does not provide a way for a task to 
  suspend itself (only another task can suspend it).  Therefore,
  the test calls rtems_task_suspend to suspend it.

  rtems_task_wake_after calls should be replaced with itron call
  when the ITRON functionality is finished.
 
output:

  XXX - Verify the output messages on this test.  It looks like
        the suspend count doesn't look correct. ??? Nov 10, 99
