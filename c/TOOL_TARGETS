The following are targets for the GNU tools (gcc, binutils, newlib, and gdb)
that are for RTEMS, their object format, and status notes

arm: arm-rtems               ELF

h8300: h8300-rtems             COFF

i386: i386-rtems		ELF

m68k: m68k-rtems		ELF

mips: mips*-rtems		ELF		Big endian
      mips*el-rtems		ELF		Little endian

	NOTE: Little endian configuration is not in all tools and 
	      is untested for RTEMS itself.

nios2: nios2-elf           ELF     Little endian

    NOTE: Currently there is no native nios2-rtems toolchain;
      Altera's nios2-elf-tools can be used with wrapper scripts.

powerpc: powerpc-rtems		ELF
	 powerpcle-rtems		ELF		Little endian

	NOTE: Little endian configuration is not in all tools and 
	      is untested for RTEMS itself.

sh: sh-rtems		ELF

sparc:
	sparc-rtems		ELF
