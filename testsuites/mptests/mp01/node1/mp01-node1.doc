This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  test50

directives:
  ex_init, ex_start, t_create, t_start, tm_tick, i_return, t_ident,
  tm_set, tm_get, tm_wkafter, t_delete

concepts:

  a.  Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system
      initialization and idle task.

  b.  Verifies executive can swap between three application tasks at the
      same priority and the executive's internal idle task.

  c.  Verifies can print strings to the CRT on port 2 of the mvme136 board
      using Print and Println in the board support package.

  d.  Verifies interrupt handler can handler a task switch from an interrupt
      as specified with the i_return directive.

  e.  Verifies executive initialization performed correctly.

  f.  Verifies the executive trap handler except for the halt function.

  g.  Verifies that a task can get the task identification number of itself.

  h.  Verifies that a task can get the task identification number
      of a global task on the local processor.

  i.  Verifies that a task can delete itself or a global task on
      the local processor.

  j.  Verifies Shared Memory Locked Queue driver for initialization,
      getting a packet, broadcasting a packet, and returning a packet.

  k.  Can be used to verify that global packet type P_SYSVERIFY,
      P_OBJCREATE (task), and P_OBJDELETE (task) are sent and
      correctly processed by a remote node.
