This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.
This test is based upon the test in sp01.

test set name: itrontask01

directives:
  cre_tsk, exd_tsk, get_tid, sta_tsk

concepts:  XXX verify

  a.  Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system

  g.  Verifies that a task can get the task identification number of itself.

  a.  Verifies exd_tsk

  b.  Verifies get_tid

notes:

  rtems clock directives should change to itron clock directives when
  the clock directives are merged.

  change rtems task wake after to itron routines.

output:
 "TA1" is printed once every 5 seconds.  
 "TA2" is printed once every 10 seconds.  
 "TA3" is printed once every 15 seconds.
