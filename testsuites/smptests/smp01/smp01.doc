This is a simple test that verifies that each of the smp
processors can run a task.  The init task creates and starts
a test_task for each prcessor.  With a small delay between
the start of each processor to allow for the processor to
print its status.  Note:  This may need to change to a semaphore
locked print routine at some point in the furture.

After the tasks have been started the init task waits for flags
to be set by each task indicating that they are running.  Once all
flags are set the program terminates.
