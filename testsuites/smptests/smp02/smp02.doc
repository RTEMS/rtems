This test creates tasks for each process (other than the 
one that Init is running on).  Then drops into a loop waiting
on a log file to fill up.  Once the log file is filled the 
information is printed and the program ends.

Each task poll for a semaphore.  Once the semaphore is 
obtained , a log the obtain and release is recorded and
the semaphore is released.  If the log is full the semaphore
is released without changing the log.
