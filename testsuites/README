This is the directory under which the RTEMS
test programs provided with the release are located.  The
following is a description of the contents of each file and
subdirectory directly in this directory:

NOTE: Other than the 'samples' directory these tests are intended
      only to exercise RTEMS features and are *not* good examples
      of programming for RTEMS.

    samples

       This directory contains a set of simple sample applications
       which can be used either to test a board support package
       or as the starting point for a custom application.

    mptests

       This directory contains the RTEMS Multiprocessor Test Suite.
       The tests in this directory provide near complete (98%+) test
       coverage of the multiprocessor specific code in RTEMS.

    psxtests

       This directory contains the RTEMS POSIX API Test Suite.
       The tests in this directory test the POSIX API support in RTEMS.

    sptests

       This directory contains the RTEMS Single Processor Test Suite.
       The tests in this directory provide near complete (98%+) test
       coverage of the non-multiprocessor code in RTEMS.

    tmtests

       This directory contains the RTEMS Timing Test Suite.
       The tests in this directory are used to measure the execution
       time of RTEMS directive and some critical internal functions.
       The results of these test are reported in the Fact Sheets
       and Supplental Manuals.
