 * @brief This test case collection provides validation test cases for the
 *   `sparc/gr712rc` BSP.
 *
 * This test case performs the following actions:
 *
 * - Validate the use of the `-mfix-gr712rc` compiler option.
 *
 *   - Check that the compiler built-in define `__FIX_LEON3FT_B2BST` is
 *     defined.
 *
 *   - Check that the compiler built-in define `__FIX_LEON3FT_TN0018` is
 *     defined.
 *
 *   - Check that the `SPARC_LEON3FT_B2BST_NOP` define expands to a `nop`
 *     instruction.
