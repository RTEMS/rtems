 * @brief Tests the thread user extensions.
 *
 * This test case performs the following actions:
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Switch to a started thread.  Delete three
 *   dynamic extension during the thread begin invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread switch extensions were invoked in the right order
 *     before the thread begin extensions.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread begin extensions were invoked in the right order.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread begin extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Create a thread.  Delete three dynamic
 *   extension during the thread create invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread create extensions were invoked in the right order.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread create extensions were invoked under protection of
 *     the allocator mutex.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread create extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Delete a thread.  Delete three dynamic
 *   extension during the thread delete invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread delete extensions were invoked in the right order.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread delete extensions were invoked under protection of
 *     the allocator mutex.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread delete extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Return from a thread entry.  Delete three
 *   dynamic extension during the thread exitted invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread exitted extensions were invoked in the right
 *     order.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread exitted extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Restart a thread.  Delete three dynamic
 *   extension during the thread restart invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread restart extensions were invoked in the right
 *     order.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread restart extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Start a thread.  Delete three dynamic
 *   extension during the thread start invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread start extensions were invoked in the right order.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread start extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Terminate a thread.  Delete three dynamic
 *   extension during the thread terminate invocation.  Clean up the used
 *   resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread terminate extensions were invoked in the right
 *     order.
 *
 *   - Check that the other extensions were not invoked.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread terminate extension of the extension set deleted
 *     before its turn in the invocation was not invoked.
 *
 * - Create five dynamic extensions.  Let an idle thread return from its entry.
 *   Delete three dynamic extension during the thread exitted invocation.
 *   Clean up the used resources.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread exitted extensions were invoked in the right
