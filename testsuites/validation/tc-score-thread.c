 *
 * @brief Tests general thread behaviour.
 *
 * This test case performs the following actions:
 *
 * - Create an extension set with a thread terminate extension which deletes
 *   the killer task if it is invoked for the worker task.  Create and start
 *   the worker task.  Create and start the killer task.  The killer task
 *   deletes the worker task.
 *
 *   - Check that the killer task was deleted.
 *
 *   - Check that the worker task still exists.
 *
 *   - Check that the life of the worker task is protected and terminating.
 *
 *   - Check that the worker task is waiting for a joining thread.
 *
 *   - Delete the worker task using brute force.
 *
 *   - Clean up all used resources.
 *
 * - Delete a thread which least recently used the floating point coprocessor.
 *
 *   - Start the worker thread.  Let it use the floating point coprocessor.
 *
 *   - Delete the worker thread and free the thread resources.
 *
 *   - Clean up all used resources.
 *
 * - Validate the global construction.  Mark that the test case executed.
 *
 *   - Check that the global constructor was called exactly once.
 *
 *   - Check that the global construction was done by the Classic API user
 *     initialization task.
 *
 *   - Check that the global constructor was called before the task entry.
 *
 * - Validate that thread dispatching does not recurse.  Issue a couple of
 *   thread context switches during a thread dispatch.  Record the stack
 *   pointers of the heir threads.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread dispatching did not recurse through the recorded
 *     stack pointers.
