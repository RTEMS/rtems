 * @brief Tests an event constant and number of the Event Manager using the
 *   Classic and system event sets of the executing task.
 *
 * This test case performs the following actions:
 *
 * - Validate the event constant.
 *
 *   - Check that the event constant is equal to the event number bit in the
 *     event set.
 *
 *   - Check that the event number bit of the event constant is not set in
 *     RTEMS_PENDING_EVENTS.
 *
 * - Get all pending events of the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 *   - Check that there were no pending events.
 *
 * - Get all pending events of the system event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 *   - Check that there were no pending events.
 *
 * - Receive all pending events of the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was unsatisfied.
 *
 *   - Check that there were no events received.
 *
 * - Receive all pending events of the system event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was unsatisfied.
 *
 *   - Check that there were no events received.
 *
 * - Send the event to the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 * - Get all pending events of the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 *   - Check that the pending event is equal to the event sent by a previous
 *     action.
 *
 * - Get all pending events of the system event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 *   - Check that there were no pending events.
 *
 * - Receive any event of the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 *   - Check that the received event is equal to the event sent by a previous
 *     action.
 *
 * - Receive any event of the system event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was unsatisfied.
 *
 *   - Check that the no events were received.
 *
 * - Send the event to the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 * - Get all pending events of the Classic event set of the executing task.
 *
 *   - Check that the directive call was successful.
 *
 *   - Check that there were no pending events.
