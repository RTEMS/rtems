 * @brief Helper file to verify the requirements towards the basedefs.
 *
 * The specification items in
 * (rtems-central/)spec/rtems/basedefs/req/[*] represent
 * requirements towards the basedefs in
 * (rtems/)cpukit/include/rtems/score/basedefs.h.
 * There are automated verification tests generated from
 * (rtems-central/)spec/rtems/basedefs/val/[*] and placed
 * in (rtems/)testsuites/validation/tc-basedefs-0.c.
 *
 * Yet, not every test can be placed in the same compilation unit
 * (tc-basedefs-0.c). Hence, the code which must be placed
 * in an extra compilation unit is put here and this file
 * is linked to tc-basedefs-0.c to be accessible from the tests.
