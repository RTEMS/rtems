This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  test1

directives:
  _Object_Allocate, _Object_Free, _Object_Extend_information, 
  _Object_Shrink_information

concepts:

  a.  Verifies when the auto-extend is false the number of objects does
      not grow, and the number of objects is the maximum number specified
      in the Configuration table.

  b.  Verify the re-allocation of index numbers, and a block of objects is
      freed while another remains yet all it objects are not in
      use. Four blocks of the allocation size of objects are created,
      then the first and third blocks are freed. Only the first
      block's memory will be released, while the second remains. This
      is due the allocation hystersis.

  c.  Allocate as many objects are the work-space can hold. Free objects
      from a number of blocks with-out freeing the blocks. Free the remaining
      blocks.
