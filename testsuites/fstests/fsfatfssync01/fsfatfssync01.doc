This file documents the test fsfatfssync01.

test set name: fsfatfssync01

test purpose:
  Verify FatFS auto-sync behavior and explicit fsync() functionality.

test description:
  Tests FatFS's synchronization behavior by:
  - Creating a file and verifying it persists after disk cache purge
  - Writing data without explicit fsync() and verifying it persists after disk cache purge
    (demonstrates FatFS auto-syncs on file close)
  - Writing additional data with explicit fsync() and verifying it persists after disk cache purge
  
  Note: Unlike traditional POSIX filesystems, FatFS automatically calls f_sync() during 
  f_close(), ensuring all writes are immediately persisted to disk regardless of whether
  fsync() was explicitly called.
