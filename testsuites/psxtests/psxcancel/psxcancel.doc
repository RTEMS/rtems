This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  psxcancel

directives:

  pthread_setcancelstate
  pthread_setcanceltype
  pthread_testcancel
  pthread_cleanup_push
  pthread_cleanup_pop
  pthread_create
  pthread_cancel
  pthread_join
 
concepts:

+ Verify that setting cancellation state and type to various
  combinations of enable/disable and deferred/asynchronous works
  as expected.

+ Verify that cleanup handlers that have been pushed do indeed run
  as expected at at cancellation point.

+ Exercise argument checking error cases in pthread_setcancelstate and
  pthread_setcanceltype.
  associated one mutex instance that it is an error for another task
  to attempt to block on the same condition variable using a different
  mutex.

+ Verify error conditions in pthread_mutexattr_settype

+ Verify normal paths through pthread_mutexattr_gettype

+ Verify normal paths through pthread_mutexattr_settype
