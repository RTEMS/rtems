This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: psx01

directives:
  pthread_create
  pthread_equal
  sched_get_priority_min
  sched_get_priority_max
  sched_rr_get_interval
  sched_yield
  uname

concepts:
+ Verify that uname gives proper error message when utsname is not defined,
  or proper data if it is 
+ Verify that sched_get_priority_min and sched_get_priority_max work as
  expected and give proper error messages when no policy is defined
+ Verify that sched_rr_get_interval works as expected and gives proper error
  messages
+ Verify that thread creation fails before thread limit is exceeded
+ Verify that thread yielding is operational
+ Verify that pthread_equal works as expected for different combinations of
  legitimate and illegitimate thread id's
