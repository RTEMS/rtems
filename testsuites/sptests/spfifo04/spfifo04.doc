This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

Configuration:

Pipes enabled.
Maximum number of barriers is set to 2.

Coverage concepts:

With number of barriers set to 2, and provided there is sufficient
memory available, fifo_open -> pipe_new must be able to create a new
pipe_control_t successfully.

This test

- Creates a directory /tmp
- Creates a fifo file /tmp/fifo01

- Opens the fifo in read-write mode, covering one of the cases of the
  switch statement (this should be successful)
- Closes the fifo

- Opens the file in read-only, non-blocing mode, covering another case
  of the switch (this should be successful)
- Closes the fifo

- Opens the file in write-only, non-blocking mode, covering yet
  another case in the switch. (this should not be successful, instead,
  since we opened the fifo in a WRONLY and NONBLOCK mode, we receive
  an ENXIO error)

- fifo_open (pipe_new) maintains a static character variable, which it
  uses to create semaphores and barriers. The value of this character
  goes from a -> z -> a -> z... To hit the case where z is wrapped
  back to a, fifo_open must be called a minimum total of 26
  times. This is achieved by repeated opens on the fifo file created.
- After every successful open, the file is closed

- Remove fifo file
- Remove tmp directory
