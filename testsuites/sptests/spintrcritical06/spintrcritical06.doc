This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  spintrcritical06

directives:

  _Thread_queue_Enqueue_priority
    - interrupt synchronization
  rtems_task_restart
  _Thread_queue_Extract_priority

concepts:

+ Ensure that removing the "search task" from the thread queue while we
  are looping and enqueuing another works as expected.  This case is where
  the TCB we are using as a current pointer is removed from the thread queue
  when we flash interrupts WHILE SEARCHING FORWARD.

NOTE: There is no way to know this case is hit from a test perspective.  The
      test just runs and we check the coverage report.
