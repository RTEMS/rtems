This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  test4

directives:
  ex_init, ex_start, t_create, t_start, tm_tick, i_return,
  tm_set, tm_get, ev_receive, t_mode

concepts:

  a.  Verifies timeslicing ( all tasks are in timeslice mode ).

  b.  Verifies the tswitch user extension.

  c.  Verifies the no preemption mode.

  d.  Verifies time-slice gets reset even if only one task ready.

output:
  The task name and the current time are printed out each time that a new
  task is being dispatched.  The configured timeslice is 100 ticks
  ( 1 second ); therefore, a task name and the time are printed once
  every second.  After each task runs 3 times, task 1 changes its mode to
  no preempt and runs for about 6 seconds and then changes its mode back to
  preempt mode.
