This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  devfs04

directives:

+ devFS_read
+ devFS_write
+ null_initialize

concepts:

+ Custom driver for a device /dev/test lets us exercise the error
paths in the read / write routines for devFS. These are invoked using
the system calls read() and write().

+ The write call is forwarded to null_write, thus exercising
null_write too.
