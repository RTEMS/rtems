 * @brief Check how rtems_bdbuf_sync() works.
 *
 * Test sequence:
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read(#N) in thread #1.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_sync(#N) in thread #1.
 * -# After a while disk driver gets write request for block #N.
 *    Notify bdbuf about write complete event.
 * -# Check that rtems_bdbuf_sync(#N) in thread #1 unlocked after this.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read(#N) in thread #2.
 * -# Check that buffer is successfully obtained in thread #2.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_release(#N) in thread #2.
