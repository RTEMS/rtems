/*! @file
 * @brief Check how rtems_bdbuf_read() and rtems_bdbuf_release_modified()
 * coexist. rtems_bdbuf_read() is blocked when required buffer is being
 * transferred.
 *
 * The same as Test 2.1, but on step 7 thread #2 calls
 * rtems_bdbuf_release_modified().
 *
 * Test sequence:
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #1 and block on
 *    waiting for read complete notification.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #2 for
 *    the same block number. As the result it blocks on this read
 *    as well (but it will block on transfer semaphore).
 * -# Disk device reports success in read complete notification.
 *    As the result rtems_bdbuf_read() function returns
 *    RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL in thread #1.
 * -# Thread #1 releases buffer with rtems_bdbuf_release_modified() function.
 * -# rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #2 unlocks and
 *    returns RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL.
 * -# Wait swapout period and check that the buffer is not requested
 *    to be flushed to a disk.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_release_modified() function in thread #2.
 * -# Check that this block number is requested for a flush in swapout period.
