/*! @file
 * @brief Check how rtems_bdbuf_read() handles two readers waiting
 * for a buffer with the same block number in cases when disk device
 * driver reports failure in read complete notification.
 *
 * Test sequence:
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #1 and block on
 *    waiting for read complete notification.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #2 for the same block
 *    number. As the result it blocks on this read as well (but it will
 *    block on transfer semaphore).
 * -# Disk device reports an error in read complete notification.
 *    As the result an error is returned from rtems_bdbuf_read()
 *    in thread #1.
 * -# rtems_bdbuf_read() called in thread #2 should try to re-read data
 *    again so disk device ioctl() function is called again for this
 *    block number.
 * -# This time disk device reports success in read complete notification.
 *    As the result rtems_bdbuf_read() in thread #2 shall return
 *    RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL and provide buffer descriptor.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_release() function in thread #2.
 * .
