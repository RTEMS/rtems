 *  _CPU_ISR_install_raw_handler
 *
 *  This routine installs the specified handler as a "raw" non-executive
 *  supported trap handler (a.k.a. interrupt service routine).
 *
 *  Input Parameters:
 *    vector      - trap table entry number plus synchronous
 *                    vs. asynchronous information
 *    new_handler - address of the handler to be installed
 *    old_handler - pointer to an address of the handler previously installed
 *
 *  Output Parameters: NONE
 *    *new_handler - address of the handler previously installed
 *
 *  NOTE:
 *
 *  On the SPARC, there are really only 256 vectors.  However, the executive
 *  has no easy, fast, reliable way to determine which traps are synchronous
 *  and which are asynchronous.  By default, synchronous traps return to the
 *  instruction which caused the interrupt.  So if you install a software
 *  trap handler as an executive interrupt handler (which is desirable since
 *  RTEMS takes care of window and register issues), then the executive needs
 *  to know that the return address is to the trap rather than the instruction
 *  following the trap.
 *
 *  So vectors 0 through 255 are treated as regular asynchronous traps which
 *  provide the "correct" return address.  Vectors 256 through 512 are assumed
 *  by the executive to be synchronous and to require that the return address
 *  be fudged.
 *
 *  If you use this mechanism to install a trap handler which must reexecute
 *  the instruction which caused the trap, then it should be installed as
 *  an asynchronous trap.  This will avoid the executive changing the return
 *  address.
