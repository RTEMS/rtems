 *  and which are asynchronous.  By default, synchronous traps return to the
 *  instruction which caused the interrupt.  So if you install a software
 *  trap handler as an executive interrupt handler (which is desirable since

 *  to know that the return address is to the trap rather than the instruction
 *  following the trap.
 *
 *  So vectors 0 through 255 are treated as regular asynchronous traps which
 *  provide the "correct" return address.  Vectors 256 through 512 are assumed
 *  by the executive to be synchronous and to require that the return address
 *  be fudged.
 *
 *  If you use this mechanism to install a trap handler which must reexecute
 *  the instruction which caused the trap, then it should be installed as
 *  an asynchronous trap.  This will avoid the executive changing the return
