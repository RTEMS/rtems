 *
 *  Conversion to MIPS port by Alan Cudmore <alanc@linuxstart.com> and
 *           Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>.
 *
 *    These changes made the code conditional on standard cpp predefines,
 *    merged the mips1 and mips3 code sequences as much as possible,
 *    and moved some of the assembly code to C.  Alan did much of the
 *    initial analysis and rework.  Joel took over from there and
 *    wrote the JMR3904 BSP so this could be tested.  Joel also
 *    added the new interrupt vectoring support in libcpu and
 *    tried to better support the various interrupt controllers.

 *  Should the calls to _Thread_Enable_dispatch be inlined?
 *
 *  If TRUE, then they are inlined.
 *  If FALSE, then a subroutine call is made.
 *
 *  Basically this is an example of the classic trade-off of size
 *  versus speed.  Inlining the call (TRUE) typically increases the
 *  size of RTEMS while speeding up the enabling of dispatching.
 *  [NOTE: In general, the _Thread_Dispatch_disable_level will
 *  only be 0 or 1 unless you are in an interrupt handler and that
 *  interrupt handler invokes the executive.]  When not inlined
 *  something calls _Thread_Enable_dispatch which in turns calls
 *  _Thread_Dispatch.  If the enable dispatch is inlined, then
 *  one subroutine call is avoided entirely.]

 *  is examined per iteration.
 *
 *  If TRUE, then the loops are unrolled.
 *  If FALSE, then the loops are not unrolled.
 *
 *  The primary factor in making this decision is the cost of disabling
 *  and enabling interrupts (_ISR_Flash) versus the cost of rest of the
 *  body of the loop.  On some CPUs, the flash is more expensive than
 *  one iteration of the loop body.  In this case, it might be desirable
 *  to unroll the loop.  It is important to note that on some CPUs, this
 *  code is the longest interrupt disable period in RTEMS.  So it is
 *  necessary to strike a balance when setting this parameter.

 *  disturned until another floating point task is switched to.
 *
 *  If FALSE, then the floating point context is saved when a floating

 *
 *  If the floating point context does NOT have to be saved as part of

 *  The deferred FP switch algorithm minimizes the number of times
 *  the FP context is saved and restored.  The FP context is not saved

 * Contexts
 *
 *  Generally there are 2 types of context to save.
 *     1. Interrupt registers to save
 *     2. Task level registers to save
 *
 *  This means we have the following 3 context items:
 *     1. task level context stuff::  Context_Control
 *     2. floating point task stuff:: Context_Control_fp
 *     3. special interrupt level context :: Context_Control_interrupt
 *
 *  On some processors, it is cost-effective to save only the callee
 *  preserved registers during a task context switch.  This means
 *  that the ISR code needs to save those registers which do not
 *  persist across function calls.  It is not mandatory to make this
 *  distinctions between the caller/callee saves registers for the
 *  purpose of minimizing context saved during task switch and on interrupts.
 *  If the cost of saving extra registers is minimal, simplicity is the
 *  choice.  Save the same context on interrupt entry as for tasks in
 *  this case.
 *
 *  Additionally, if gdb is to be made aware of RTEMS tasks for this CPU, then
 *  care should be used in designing the context area.
 *
 *  On some CPUs with hardware floating point support, the Context_Control_fp
 *  structure will not be used or it simply consist of an array of a
 *  fixed number of bytes.   This is done when the floating point context
 *  is dumped by a "FP save context" type instruction and the format
 *  is not really defined by the CPU.  In this case, there is no need
 *  to figure out the exact format -- only the size.  Of course, although
 *  this is enough information for RTEMS, it is probably not enough for
 *  a debugger such as gdb.  But that is another problem.

 *  This type may be either 16 or 32 bits wide although only the 16
 *  least significant bits will be used.
 *
 *  There are a number of variables in using a "find first bit" type
 *  instruction.
 *
 *    (1) What happens when run on a value of zero?
 *    (2) Bits may be numbered from MSB to LSB or vice-versa.
 *    (3) The numbering may be zero or one based.
 *    (4) The "find first bit" instruction may search from MSB or LSB.
 *
 *  RTEMS guarantees that (1) will never happen so it is not a concern.
 *  (2),(3), (4) are handled by the macros _CPU_Priority_mask() and
 *  _CPU_Priority_bits_index().  These three form a set of routines
 *  which must logically operate together.  Bits in the _value are
 *  set and cleared based on masks built by _CPU_Priority_mask().
 *  The basic major and minor values calculated by _Priority_Major()
 *  and _Priority_Minor() are "massaged" by _CPU_Priority_bits_index()
 *  to properly range between the values returned by the "find first bit"
 *  instruction.  This makes it possible for _Priority_Get_highest() to
 *  calculate the major and directly index into the minor table.
 *  This mapping is necessary to ensure that 0 (a high priority major/minor)
 *  is the first bit found.
 *
 *  This entire "find first bit" and mapping process depends heavily
 *  on the manner in which a priority is broken into a major and minor
 *  components with the major being the 4 MSB of a priority and minor
 *  the 4 LSB.  Thus (0 << 4) + 0 corresponds to priority 0 -- the highest
 *  priority.  And (15 << 4) + 14 corresponds to priority 254 -- the next
 *  to the lowest priority.
 *
 *  If your CPU does not have a "find first bit" instruction, then
 *  there are ways to make do without it.  Here are a handful of ways
 *  to implement this in software:
 *
 *    - a series of 16 bit test instructions
 *    - a "binary search using if's"
 *    - _number = 0
 *      if _value > 0x00ff
 *        _value >>=8
 *        _number = 8;
 *
 *      if _value > 0x0000f
 *        _value >=8
 *        _number += 4
 *
 *      _number += bit_set_table[ _value ]
 *
 *    where bit_set_table[ 16 ] has values which indicate the first
 *      bit set
