 *  _CORE_spinlock_Wait
 *
 *  This function waits for the spinlock to become available.  Optionally,
 *  a limit may be placed on the duration of the spin.
 *
 *  Input parameters:
 *    the_spinlock - the spinlock control block to initialize
 *    wait         - true if willing to wait
 *    timeout      - the maximum number of ticks to spin (0 is forever)
 *
 *  Output parameters:  NONE

       *  so other threads have a chance to run.
