  /*
   *  Currently, RTEMS supports no API that has both flush and blocking
   *  sends.  Thus, this routine assumes that there are no senders
   *  blocked waiting to send messages.  In the event, that an API is
   *  added that can flush a message queue when threads are blocked
   *  waiting to send, there are two basic behaviors envisioned:
   *
   *  (1) The thread queue of pending senders is a logical extension
   *  of the pending message queue.  In this case, it should be
   *  flushed using the _Thread_queue_Flush_critical() service with a status
   *  such as CORE_MESSAGE_QUEUE_SENDER_FLUSHED (which currently does
   *  not exist).  This can be implemented without changing the "big-O"
   *  of the message flushing part of the routine.
   *
   *  (2) Only the actual messages queued should be purged.  In this case,
   *  the blocked sender threads must be allowed to send their messages.
   *  In this case, the implementation will be forced to individually
   *  dequeue the senders and queue their messages.  This will force
   *  this routine to have "big O(n)" where n is the number of blocked
   *  senders.  If there are more messages pending than senders blocked,
   *  then the existing flush code can be used to dispose of the remaining
   *  pending messages.
   *
   *  For now, though, we are very happy to have a small routine with
   *  fixed execution time that only deals with pending messages.
