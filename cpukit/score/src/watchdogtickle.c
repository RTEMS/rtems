   * For some reason, on rare occasions the_watchdog->delta_interval
   * of the head of the watchdog chain is 0.  Before this test was
   * added, on these occasions an event (which usually was supposed
   * to have a timeout of 1 tick would have a delta_interval of 0, which
   * would be decremented to 0xFFFFFFFF by the unprotected
   * "the_watchdog->delta_interval--;" operation.
   * This would mean the event would not timeout, and also the chain would
   * be blocked, because a timeout with a very high number would be at the
   * head, rather than at the end.
   * The test "if (the_watchdog->delta_interval != 0)"
   * here prevents this from occuring.
   *
   * We were not able to categorically identify the situation that causes
   * this, but proved it to be true empirically.  So this check causes
   * correct behaviour in this circumstance.
   *
   * The belief is that a race condition exists whereby an event at the head
   * of the chain is removed (by a pending ISR or higher priority task)
   * during the _ISR_Flash( level ); in _Watchdog_Insert, but the watchdog
   * to be inserted has already had its delta_interval adjusted to 0, and
   * so is added to the head of the chain with a delta_interval of 0.
