/**
 *  @defgroup ScorePriority Priority Handler
 *
 *  @ingroup Score
 *
 *  This handler encapsulates functionality which is used to manage
 *  thread priorities.  At the SuperCore level 256 priority levels
 *  are supported with lower numbers representing logically more important
 *  threads.  The priority level 0 is reserved for internal RTEMS use.
 *  Typically it is assigned to threads which defer internal RTEMS
 *  actions from an interrupt to thread level to improve interrupt response.
 *  Priority level 255 is assigned to the IDLE thread and really should not
 *  be used by application threads.  The default IDLE thread implementation
 *  is an infinite "branch to self" loop which never yields to other threads
 *  at the same priority.
