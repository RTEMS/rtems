This is a snapshot of my attempt to fit the FreeBSD networking code into
RTEMS.  Things seem to be working!

Things that need to be done:
	1) More documentation!
	2) Figure out what's still not working :-)
	3) Rationalize the include files.  Right now I have a special
	   hack in the Makefile to ensure that I pick up the FreeBSD versions
	   of the include files that are duplicated between RTEMS
	   and FreeBSD.
	   The network device driver source should move to the BSP source tree.
	4) Have a look at all the FIXME comments.
	5) Go through and make sure that all the source files are
	   free of undesired copyright restrictions.
