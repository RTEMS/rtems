/*
 * The checksum computation code here is significantly faster than its
 * vanilla C counterpart (by significantly, I mean 2-3 times faster if
 * the data is in cache, and 1.5-2 times faster if the data is not in
 * cache).
 * We optimize on three fronts:
 *	1. By using the add-with-carry (addxcc) instruction, we can use
 *	   32-bit operations instead of 16-bit operations.
 *	2. By unrolling the main loop to reduce branch overheads.
 *	3. By doing a sequence of load,load,add,add,load,load,add,add,
 *	   we can avoid the extra stall cycle which is incurred if the
 *	   instruction immediately following a load tries to use the
 *	   target register of the load.
 * Another possible optimization is to replace a pair of 32-bit loads
 * with a single 64-bit load (ldd) instruction, but I found that although
 * this improves performance somewhat on Sun4c machines, it actually
 * reduces performance considerably on Sun4m machines (I don't know why).
 * So I chose to leave it out.
