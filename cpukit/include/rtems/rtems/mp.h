/**
 * @defgroup RTEMSAPIClassicMP Multiprocessing Manager
 *
 * @ingroup RTEMSAPIClassic
 *
 * @brief The Multiprocessing Manager provides support for heterogeneous
 *   multiprocessing systems based on message passing in a network of
 *   multiprocessing nodes.
 *
 * In multiprocessor real-time systems, new requirements, such as sharing data
 * and global resources between processors, are introduced.  This requires an
 * efficient and reliable communications vehicle which allows all processors to
 * communicate with each other as necessary.  In addition, the ramifications of
 * multiple processors affect each and every characteristic of a real-time
 * system, almost always making them more complicated.
 *
 * RTEMS addresses these issues by providing simple and flexible real-time
 * multiprocessing capabilities.  The executive easily lends itself to both
 * tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled configurations of the target system
 * hardware.  In addition, RTEMS supports systems composed of both homogeneous
 * and heterogeneous mixtures of processors and target boards.
 *
 * A major design goal of the RTEMS executive was to transcend the physical
 * boundaries of the target hardware configuration.  This goal is achieved by
 * presenting the application software with a logical view of the target system
 * where the boundaries between processor nodes are transparent.  As a result,
 * the application developer may designate objects such as tasks, queues,
 * events, signals, semaphores, and memory blocks as global objects.  These
 * global objects may then be accessed by any task regardless of the physical
 * location of the object and the accessing task.  RTEMS automatically
 * determines that the object being accessed resides on another processor and
 * performs the actions required to access the desired object.  Simply stated,
 * RTEMS allows the entire system, both hardware and software, to be viewed
 * logically as a single system.

 * @brief Announces the arrival of a packet.
 *
 * This directive informs RTEMS that a multiprocessing communications packet
 * has arrived from another node.  This directive is called by the
 * user-provided MPCI, and is only used in multiprocessing configurations.
 *
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * This directive is typically called from an ISR.
 *
 * This directive does not generate activity on remote nodes.
 * @endparblock
 *
 * @par Constraints
 * @parblock
 * The following constraints apply to this directive:
 *
 * - The directive may be called from within interrupt context.
 *
 * - The directive may be called from within device driver initialization
 *   context.
 *
 * - The directive may be called from within task context.
 *
 * - The directive may unblock a task.  This may cause the calling task to be
 *   preempted.
