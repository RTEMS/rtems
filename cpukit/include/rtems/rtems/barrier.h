/**
 * @ingroup RTEMSAPIClassicBarrier
 *
 * @brief Creates a barrier.
 *
 * @param name is the object name of the barrier.
 *
 * @param attribute_set is the attribute set of the barrier.
 *
 * @param maximum_waiters is the maximum count of waiters on an automatic
 *   release barrier.
 *
 * @param id is the pointer to an ::rtems_id object.  When the directive call
 *   is successful, the identifier of the created barrier will be stored in
 *   this object.
 *
 * This directive creates a barrier which resides on the local node.  The
 * barrier has the user-defined object name specified in ``name`` and the
 * initial count specified in ``attribute_set``.  The assigned object
 * identifier is returned in ``id``.  This identifier is used to access the
 * barrier with other barrier related directives.
 *
 * The **attribute set** specified in ``attribute_set`` is built through a
 * *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
 * combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
 * exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
 * undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
 * directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
 * the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES constant.
 *
 * The **barrier class** is selected by the mutually exclusive
 * #RTEMS_BARRIER_MANUAL_RELEASE and #RTEMS_BARRIER_AUTOMATIC_RELEASE
 * attributes.
 *
 * * The **manual release class** is the default and can be emphasized through
 *   use of the #RTEMS_BARRIER_MANUAL_RELEASE attribute.  For this class, there
 *   is no limit on the number of tasks that will block at the barrier. Only
 *   when the rtems_barrier_release() directive is invoked, are the tasks
 *   waiting at the barrier unblocked.
 *
 * * The **automatic release class** is selected by the
 *   #RTEMS_BARRIER_AUTOMATIC_RELEASE attribute.  For this class, tasks calling
 *   the rtems_barrier_wait() directive will block until there are
 *   ``maximum_waiters`` minus one tasks waiting at the barrier.  When the
 *   ``maximum_waiters`` task invokes the rtems_barrier_wait() directive, the
 *   previous ``maximum_waiters`` - 1 tasks are automatically released and the
 *   caller returns.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL The requested operation was successful.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_NAME The ``name`` parameter was invalid.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``id`` parameter was NULL.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_NUMBER The ``maximum_waiters`` parameter was 0 for
 *   an automatic release barrier.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_TOO_MANY There was no inactive object available to create a
 *   barrier.  The number of barriers available to the application is
 *   configured through the @ref CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_BARRIERS application
 *   configuration option.
 *
 * @par Notes
 * For control and maintenance of the barrier, RTEMS allocates a BCB from the
 * local BCB free pool and initializes it.
 *
 * @par Constraints
 * @parblock
 * The following constraints apply to this directive:
 *
 * - The directive may be called from within device driver initialization
 *   context.
 *
 * - The directive may be called from within task context.
 *
 * - The directive may obtain and release the object allocator mutex.  This may
 *   cause the calling task to be preempted.
 *
 * - The number of barriers available to the application is configured through
 *   the @ref CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_BARRIERS application configuration option.
 *
 * - Where the object class corresponding to the directive is configured to use
 *   unlimited objects, the directive may allocate memory from the RTEMS
 *   Workspace.
