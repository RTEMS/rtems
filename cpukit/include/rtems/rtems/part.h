 * @ingroup RTEMSAPIClassicPart
 *
 * @brief Creates a partition.
 *
 * @param name is the object name of the partition.
 *
 * @param starting_address is the starting address of the buffer area used by
 *   the partition.
 *
 * @param length is the length in bytes of the buffer area used by the
 *   partition.
 *
 * @param buffer_size is the size in bytes of a buffer managed by the
 *   partition.
 *
 * @param attribute_set is the attribute set of the partition.
 *
 * @param[out] id is the pointer to an ::rtems_id object.  When the directive
 *   call is successful, the identifier of the created partition will be stored
 *   in this object.
 *
 * This directive creates a partition of fixed size buffers from a physically
 * contiguous memory space which starts at ``starting_address`` and is
 * ``length`` bytes in size.  Each allocated buffer is to be of ``buffer_size``
 * in bytes.  The partition has the user-defined object name specified in
 * ``name``.  The assigned object identifier is returned in ``id``.  This
 * identifier is used to access the partition with other partition related
 * directives.
 *
 * The **attribute set** specified in ``attribute_set`` is built through a
 * *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
 * combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
 * exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
 * undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
 * directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
 * the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES constant.
 *
 * The partition has a local or global **scope** in a multiprocessing network
 * (this attribute does not refer to SMP systems).  The scope is selected by
 * the mutually exclusive #RTEMS_LOCAL and #RTEMS_GLOBAL attributes.
 *
 * * A **local scope** is the default and can be emphasized through the use of
 *   the #RTEMS_LOCAL attribute.  A local partition can be only used by the
 *   node which created it.
 *
 * * A **global scope** is established if the #RTEMS_GLOBAL attribute is set.
 *   The memory space used for the partition must reside in shared memory.
 *   Setting the global attribute in a single node system has no effect.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL The requested operation was successful.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_NAME The ``name`` parameter was invalid.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``id`` parameter was NULL.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_SIZE The ``length`` parameter was 0.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_SIZE The ``buffer_size`` parameter was 0.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_SIZE The ``length`` parameter was less than the
 *   ``buffer_size`` parameter.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_SIZE The ``buffer_size`` parameter was not an
 *   integral multiple of the pointer size.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_SIZE The ``buffer_size`` parameter was less than two
 *   times the pointer size.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``starting_address`` parameter was not
 *   on a pointer size boundary.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_TOO_MANY There was no inactive object available to create a
 *   partition.  The number of partitions available to the application is
 *   configured through the @ref CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PARTITIONS application
 *   configuration option.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_TOO_MANY In multiprocessing configurations, there was no
 *   inactive global object available to create a global semaphore.  The number
 *   of global objects available to the application is configured through the
 *   @ref CONFIGURE_MP_MAXIMUM_GLOBAL_OBJECTS application configuration option.
 *
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * The partition buffer area specified by the ``starting_address`` must be
 * properly aligned.  It must be possible to directly store target architecture
 * pointers and also the user data.  For example, if the user data contains
 * some long double or vector data types, the partition buffer area and the
 * buffer size must take the alignment of these types into account which is
 * usually larger than the pointer alignment.  A cache line alignment may be
 * also a factor.  Use #RTEMS_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT to specify the minimum
 * alignment of a partition buffer type.
 *
 * The ``buffer_size`` parameter must be an integral multiple of the pointer
 * size on the target architecture.  Additionally, ``buffer_size`` must be
 * large enough to hold two pointers on the target architecture.  This is
 * required for RTEMS to manage the buffers when they are free.
 *
 * For control and maintenance of the partition, RTEMS allocates a PTCB from
 * the local PTCB free pool and initializes it. Memory from the partition
 * buffer area is not used by RTEMS to store the PTCB.
 *
 * The PTCB for a global partition is allocated on the local node.  Partitions
 * should not be made global unless remote tasks must interact with the
 * partition.  This is to avoid the overhead incurred by the creation of a
 * global partition.  When a global partition is created, the partition's name
 * and identifier must be transmitted to every node in the system for insertion
 * in the local copy of the global object table.

 *
 * - The directive may be called from within device driver initialization
 *   context.
