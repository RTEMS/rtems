 *   this object.
 *
 * This directive creates a task which resides on the local node.  The task has
 * the user-defined object name specified in ``name``.  The assigned object
 * identifier is returned in ``id``.  This identifier is used to access the
 * task with other task related directives.
 *
 * The **initial priority** of the task is specified in ``initial_priority``.
 * The home scheduler of the created task is the home scheduler of the calling
 * task at some time point during the task creation. The initial task priority
 * specified in ``initial_priority`` shall be valid for this scheduler.
 *
 * The **stack size** of the task is specified in ``stack_size``.  If the
 * requested stack size is less than the configured minimum stack size, then
 * RTEMS will use the configured minimum as the stack size for this task.  The
 * configured minimum stack size is defined by the @ref
 * CONFIGURE_MINIMUM_TASK_STACK_SIZE application configuration option.  In
 * addition to being able to specify the task stack size as a integer, there
 * are two constants which may be specified:
 *
 * * The #RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE constant can be specified to use the
 *   **recommended minimum stack size** for the target processor.  This value
 *   is selected by the RTEMS maintainers conservatively to minimize the risk
 *   of blown stacks for most user applications.  Using this constant when
 *   specifying the task stack size, indicates that the stack size will be at
 *   least #RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE bytes in size.  If the user configured
 *   minimum stack size is larger than the recommended minimum, then it will be
 *   used.
 *
 * * The #RTEMS_CONFIGURED_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE constant can be specified to use
 *   the minimum stack size that was configured by the application.  If not
 *   explicitly configured by the application, the default configured minimum
 *   stack size is the target processor dependent value
 *   #RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE.  Since this uses the configured minimum stack
 *   size value, you may get a stack size that is smaller or larger than the
 *   recommended minimum.  This can be used to provide large stacks for all
 *   tasks on complex applications or small stacks on applications that are
 *   trying to conserve memory.
 *
 * The **initial mode set** specified in ``initial_modes`` is built through a
 * *bitwise or* of the mode constants described below.  Not all combinations of
 * modes are allowed.  Some modes are mutually exclusive.  If mutually
 * exclusive modes are combined, the behaviour is undefined.  Default task
 * modes can be selected by using the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_MODES constant.  The task
 * mode set defines
 *
 * * the preemption mode of the task: #RTEMS_PREEMPT (default) or
 *   #RTEMS_NO_PREEMPT,
 *
 * * the timeslicing mode of the task: #RTEMS_TIMESLICE or #RTEMS_NO_TIMESLICE
 *   (default),
 *
 * * the ASR processing mode of the task: #RTEMS_ASR (default) or
 *   #RTEMS_NO_ASR,
 *
 * * the interrupt level of the task: RTEMS_INTERRUPT_LEVEL() with a default of
 *   `RTEMS_INTERRUPT_LEVEL( 0 )` which is associated with enabled interrupts.
 *
 * The **initial preemption mode** of the task is enabled or disabled.
 *
 * * An **enabled preemption** is the default and can be emphasized through the
 *   use of the #RTEMS_PREEMPT mode constant.
 *
 * * A **disabled preemption** is set by the #RTEMS_NO_PREEMPT mode constant.
 *
 * The **initial timeslicing mode** of the task is enabled or disabled.
 *
 * * A **disabled timeslicing** is the default and can be emphasized through
 *   the use of the #RTEMS_NO_TIMESLICE mode constant.
 *
 * * An **enabled timeslicing** is set by the #RTEMS_TIMESLICE mode constant.
 *
 * The **initial ASR processing mode** of the task is enabled or disabled.
 *
 * * An **enabled ASR processing** is the default and can be emphasized through
 *   the use of the #RTEMS_ASR mode constant.
 *
 * * A **disabled ASR processing** is set by the #RTEMS_NO_ASR mode constant.
 *
 * The **initial interrupt level mode** of the task is defined by
 * RTEMS_INTERRUPT_LEVEL().
 *
 * * Task execution with **interrupts enabled** the default and can be
 *   emphasized through the use of the RTEMS_INTERRUPT_LEVEL() mode macro with
 *   a value of zero (0) for the parameter.  An interrupt level of zero is
 *   associated with enabled interrupts on all target processors.
 *
 * * Task execution at a **non-zero interrupt level** can be specified by the
 *   RTEMS_INTERRUPT_LEVEL() mode macro with a non-zero value for the
 *   parameter.  The interrupt level portion of the task mode supports a
 *   maximum of 256 interrupt levels.  These levels are mapped onto the
 *   interrupt levels actually supported by the target processor in a processor
 *   dependent fashion.
 *
 * The **attribute set** specified in ``attribute_set`` is built through a
 * *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
 * combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
 * exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
 * undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
 * directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
 * the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES constant.  The attribute set defines
 *
 * * the scope of the task: #RTEMS_LOCAL (default) or #RTEMS_GLOBAL and
 *
 * * the floating-point unit use of the task: #RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT or
 *   #RTEMS_NO_FLOATING_POINT (default).
 *
 * The task has a local or global **scope** in a multiprocessing network (this
 * attribute does not refer to SMP systems).  The scope is selected by the
 * mutually exclusive #RTEMS_LOCAL and #RTEMS_GLOBAL attributes.
 *
 * * A **local scope** is the default and can be emphasized through the use of
 *   the #RTEMS_LOCAL attribute.  A local task can be only used by the node
 *   which created it.
 *
 * * A **global scope** is established if the #RTEMS_GLOBAL attribute is set.
 *   Setting the global attribute in a single node system has no effect.the
 *
 * The **use of the floating-point unit** is selected by the mutually exclusive
 * #RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT and #RTEMS_NO_FLOATING_POINT attributes.  On some
 * target processors, the use of the floating-point unit can be enabled or
 * disabled for each task.  Other target processors may have no hardware
 * floating-point unit or enable the use of the floating-point unit for all
 * tasks.  Consult the *RTEMS CPU Architecture Supplement* for the details.
 *
 * * A **disabled floating-point unit** is the default and can be emphasized
 *   through use of the #RTEMS_NO_FLOATING_POINT attribute.  For performance
 *   reasons, it is recommended that tasks not using the floating-point unit
 *   should specify this attribute.
 *
 * * An **enabled floating-point unit** is selected by the

 * The task processor affinity is initialized to the set of online processors.
 *
 * When created, a task is placed in the dormant state and can only be made

 *
 * Application developers should consider the stack usage of the device drivers
 * when calculating the stack size required for tasks which utilize the driver.
 * The task stack size shall account for an target processor dependent

 *
 * For control and maintenance of the task, RTEMS allocates a TCB from the

 *
 * The TCB for a global task is allocated on the local node.  Task should not
 * be made global unless remote tasks must interact with the task.  This is to

 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * In contrast to tasks created by rtems_task_create(), the tasks constructed
 * by this directive use a user-provided task storage area.  The task storage
 * area contains the task stack, the thread-local storage, and the
 * floating-point context on architectures with a separate floating-point
 * context.
 *
 * This directive is intended for applications which do not want to use the
 * RTEMS Workspace and instead statically allocate all operating system
 * resources.  It is not recommended to use rtems_task_create() and
 * rtems_task_construct() together in an application.  It is also not
 * recommended to use rtems_task_construct() for drivers or general purpose
 * libraries.  The reason for these recommendations is that the task
 * configuration needs settings which can be only given with a through
 * knowledge of the application resources.
 *
 * An application based solely on static allocation can avoid any runtime
 * memory allocators.  This can simplify the application architecture as well
 * as any analysis that may be required.

 *
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * The task deletion is done in several steps.  Firstly, the task is marked as
 * terminating.  While the task life of the terminating task is protected, it
 * executes normally until it disables the task life protection or it deletes
 * itself.  A terminating task will eventually stop its normal execution and
 * start its termination procedure.  The procedure executes in the context of
 * the terminating task.  The task termination procedure involves the
 * destruction of POSIX key values and running the task termination user
 * extensions.  Once complete the execution of the task is stopped and
 * task-specific resources are reclaimed by the system, such as the stack
 * memory, any allocated delay or timeout timers, the TCB, and, if the task is
 * #RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT, its floating point context area.  RTEMS explicitly
 * does not reclaim the following resources: region segments, partition
 * buffers, semaphores, timers, or rate monotonic periods.
 *
 * A task is responsible for releasing its resources back to RTEMS before
 * deletion.  To insure proper deallocation of resources, a task should not be
 * deleted unless it is unable to execute or does not hold any RTEMS resources.
 * If a task holds RTEMS resources, the task should be allowed to deallocate
 * its resources before deletion.  A task can be directed to release its
 * resources and delete itself by restarting it with a special argument or by
 * sending it a message, an event, or a signal.
 *
 * Deletion of the calling task (#RTEMS_SELF) will force RTEMS to select
 * another task to execute.
 *
 * When a task deletes another task, the calling task waits until the task
 * termination procedure of the task being deleted has completed.  The
 * terminating task inherits the eligible priorities of the calling task.
 *
 * When a global task is deleted, the task identifier must be transmitted to
 * every node in the system for deletion from the local copy of the global
 * object table.
 *
 * The task must reside on the local node, even if the task was created with
 * the #RTEMS_GLOBAL attribute.
