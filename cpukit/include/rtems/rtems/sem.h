/**
 * @ingroup RTEMSAPIClassicSem
 *
 * @brief Creates a semaphore.
 *
 * @param name is the object name of the semaphore.
 *
 * @param count is the initial count of the semaphore.  If the semaphore is a
 *   binary semaphore, then a count of 0 will make the calling task the owner
 *   of the binary semaphore and a count of 1 will create a binary semaphore
 *   without an owner.
 *
 * @param attribute_set is the attribute set of the semaphore.
 *
 * @param priority_ceiling is the priority ceiling if the semaphore is a binary
 *   semaphore with the priority ceiling or MrsP locking protocol as defined by
 *   the attribute set.
 *
 * @param[out] id is the pointer to an ::rtems_id object.  When the directive
 *   call is successful, the identifier of the created semaphore will be stored
 *   in this object.
 *
 * This directive creates a semaphore which resides on the local node.  The
 * semaphore has the user-defined object name specified in ``name`` and the
 * initial count specified in ``count``.  The assigned object identifier is
 * returned in ``id``.  This identifier is used to access the semaphore with
 * other semaphore related directives.
 *
 * The **attribute set** specified in ``attribute_set`` is built through a
 * *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
 * combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
 * exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
 * undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
 * directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
 * the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES constant.  The attribute set defines
 *
 * * the scope of the semaphore: #RTEMS_LOCAL (default) or #RTEMS_GLOBAL,
 *
 * * the task wait queue discipline used by the semaphore: #RTEMS_FIFO
 *   (default) or #RTEMS_PRIORITY,
 *
 * * the class of the semaphore: #RTEMS_COUNTING_SEMAPHORE (default),
 *   #RTEMS_BINARY_SEMAPHORE, or #RTEMS_SIMPLE_BINARY_SEMAPHORE, and
 *
 * * the locking protocol of a binary semaphore: no locking protocol (default),
 *   #RTEMS_INHERIT_PRIORITY, #RTEMS_PRIORITY_CEILING, or
 *   #RTEMS_MULTIPROCESSOR_RESOURCE_SHARING.
 *
 * The semaphore has a local or global **scope** in a multiprocessing network
 * (this attribute does not refer to SMP systems).  The scope is selected by
 * the mutually exclusive #RTEMS_LOCAL and #RTEMS_GLOBAL attributes.
 *
 * * A **local scope** is the default and can be emphasized through the use of
 *   the #RTEMS_LOCAL attribute.  A local semaphore can be only used by the
 *   node which created it.
 *
 * * A **global scope** is established if the #RTEMS_GLOBAL attribute is set.
 *   Setting the global attribute in a single node system has no effect.
 *
 * The **task wait queue discipline** is selected by the mutually exclusive
 * #RTEMS_FIFO and #RTEMS_PRIORITY attributes.
 *
 * * The **FIFO discipline** is the default and can be emphasized through use
 *   of the #RTEMS_FIFO attribute.
 *
 * * The **priority discipline** is selected by the #RTEMS_PRIORITY attribute.
 *   The locking protocols require the priority discipline.
 *
 * The **semaphore class** is selected by the mutually exclusive
 * #RTEMS_COUNTING_SEMAPHORE, #RTEMS_BINARY_SEMAPHORE, and
 * #RTEMS_SIMPLE_BINARY_SEMAPHORE attributes.
 *
 * * The **counting semaphore class** is the default and can be emphasized
 *   through use of the #RTEMS_COUNTING_SEMAPHORE attribute.
 *
 * * The **binary semaphore class** is selected by the #RTEMS_BINARY_SEMAPHORE
 *   attribute.  Binary semaphores are mutual exclusion (mutex) synchronization
 *   primitives which may have an owner.  The count of a binary semaphore is
 *   restricted to 0 and 1 values.
 *
 * * The **simple binary semaphore class** is selected by the
 *   #RTEMS_SIMPLE_BINARY_SEMAPHORE attribute.  Simple binary semaphores have
 *   no owner.  They may be used for task and interrupt synchronization.  The
 *   count of a simple binary semaphore is restricted to 0 and 1 values.
 *
 * Binary semaphores may use a **locking protocol**.  If a locking protocol is
 * selected, then the scope shall be local and the priority task wait queue
 * discipline shall be selected.  The locking protocol is selected by the
 * mutually exclusive #RTEMS_INHERIT_PRIORITY, #RTEMS_PRIORITY_CEILING, and
 * #RTEMS_MULTIPROCESSOR_RESOURCE_SHARING attributes.
 *
 * * The default is **no locking protocol**.  This can be emphasized through
 *   use of the #RTEMS_NO_INHERIT_PRIORITY,
 *   #RTEMS_NO_MULTIPROCESSOR_RESOURCE_SHARING, and #RTEMS_NO_PRIORITY_CEILING
 *   attributes.
 *
 * * The **priority inheritance locking protocol** is selected by the
 *   #RTEMS_INHERIT_PRIORITY attribute.
 *
 * * The **priority ceiling locking protocol** is selected by the
 *   #RTEMS_PRIORITY_CEILING attribute.  For this locking protocol a priority
 *   ceiling shall be specified in ``priority_ceiling``.
 *
 * * The **MrsP locking protocol** is selected by the
 *   #RTEMS_MULTIPROCESSOR_RESOURCE_SHARING attribute in SMP configurations,
 *   otherwise this attribute selects the **priority ceiling locking
 *   protocol**.  For these locking protocols a priority ceiling shall be
 *   specified in ``priority_ceiling``.  This priority is used to set the
 *   priority ceiling for all schedulers.  This can be changed later with the
 *   rtems_semaphore_set_priority() directive using the returned object
 *   identifier.

 * For control and maintenance of the semaphore, RTEMS allocates a SMCB from

 * semaphore.  This is to avoid the system overhead incurred by the creation of

 * name and identifier must be transmitted to every node in the system for
 * insertion in the local copy of the global object table.

/**
 * @ingroup RTEMSAPIClassicSem
 *
 * @brief Sets the priority by scheduler for the semaphore.
 *
 * @param semaphore_id is the semaphore identifier.
 *
 * @param scheduler_id is the identifier of the scheduler corresponding to the
 *   new priority.
 *
 * @param new_priority is the new priority corresponding to the specified
 *   scheduler.
 *
 * @param[out] old_priority is the pointer to an ::rtems_task_priority object.
 *   When the directive call is successful, the old priority of the semaphore
 *   corresponding to the specified scheduler will be stored in this object.
 *
 * This directive sets the priority of the semaphore specified by
 * ``semaphore_id``.  The priority corresponds to the scheduler specified by
 * ``scheduler_id``.
 *
 * The special priority value #RTEMS_CURRENT_PRIORITY can be used to get the
 * current priority without changing it.
 *
 * The availability and use of a priority depends on the class and locking
 * protocol of the semaphore:
 *
 * * For local, binary semaphores using the MrsP locking protocol, the ceiling
 *   priority for each scheduler can be set by this directive.
 *
 * * For local, binary semaphores using the priority ceiling protocol, the
 *   ceiling priority can be set by this directive.
 *
 * * For other semaphore classes and locking protocols, setting a priority is
 *   undefined behaviour.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL The requested operation was successful.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``old_priority`` parameter was NULL.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ID There was no scheduler associated with the
 *   identifier specified by ``scheduler_id``.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ID There was no semaphore associated with the
 *   identifier specified by ``semaphore_id``.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_ILLEGAL_ON_REMOTE_OBJECT The semaphore resided on a remote
 *   node.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_PRIORITY The ``new_priority`` parameter was invalid.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_NOT_DEFINED Setting a priority for the class or locking
 *   protocol of the semaphore is undefined behaviour.
