 *
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * The rtems_interrupt_get_priority() directive may be used to get the priority
 * associated with an interrupt vector.
 *
 * The interrupt prioritization support depends on the interrupt controller of
 * the target.  It is strongly recommended to read the relevant hardware
 * documentation.  What happens when the priority of a pending or active
 * interrupt is changed, depends on the interrupt controller.  In general, you
 * should set the interrupt priority of an interrupt vector before a handler is
 * installed.  On some interrupt controllers, setting the priority to the
 * maximum value (lowest importance) effectively disables the interrupt.
 *
 * On some architectures, a range of interrupt priority values may be not
 * disabled by the interrupt disable directives such as
 * rtems_interrupt_disable() and rtems_interrupt_local_disable().  These
 * interrupts are called non-maskable interrupts. Handlers of non-maskable
 * interrupts shall not use operating system services. In addition,
 * non-maskable interrupts may be not installable through
 * rtems_interrupt_entry_install() or rtems_interrupt_handler_install(), and
 * may require architecture-specific prologue and epilogue code.
 *
 * The interrupt priority settings affect the maximum nesting depth while
 * servicing interrupts.  The interrupt stack size calculation needs to take
 * this into account, see also @ref CONFIGURE_INTERRUPT_STACK_SIZE.
 *
 * For the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC), an 8-bit priority value is
 * supported.  The granularity of the priority levels depends on the interrupt
 * controller configuration.  Some low-order bits of a priority value may be
 * read-as-zero (RAZ) and writes are ignored (WI).  Where group 0 (FIQ) and
 * group 1 (IRQ) interrupts are used, it is recommended to use the lower half
 * of the supported priority value range for the group 0 interrupts and the
 * upper half for group 1 interrupts.  This ensures that group 1 interrupts
 * cannot preempt group 0 interrupts.
 *
 * For the Armv7-M Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC), an 8-bit priority
 * value is supported.  The granularity of the priority levels depends on the
 * interrupt controller configuration.  Some lower bits of a priority value may
 * be read-as-zero (RAZ) and writes are ignored (WI).  Interrupts with a
 * priority value less than 128 are not disabled by the RTEMS interrupt disable
 * directives.  Handlers of such interrupts shall not use operating system
 * services.
 *
 * For the RISC-V Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC), all priority
 * values from 0 up to and including the 0xffffffff are supported since the
 * priority for the PLIC is defined by a write-any-read-legal (WARL) register.
 * Please note that for this directive in contrast to the PLIC, a higher
 * priority value is associated with a lower importance.  The maximum priority
 * value (mapped to the value 0 for the PLIC) is reserved to mean "never
 * interrupt" and effectively disables the interrupt.
 *
 * For the QorIQ Multicore Programmable Interrupt Controller (MPIC), a 4-bit
 * priority value is supported.  Please note that for this directive in
 * contrast to the MPIC, a higher priority value is associated with a lower
 * importance. The maximum priority value of 15 (mapped to the value 0 for the
 * MPIC) inhibits signalling of this interrupt.
 *
 * Consult the *RTEMS CPU Architecture Supplement* and the BSP documentation in
 * the *RTEMS User Manual* for further information.
