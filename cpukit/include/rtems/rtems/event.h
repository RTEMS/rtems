 *
 * This directive can be used to
 *
 * * get the pending events of the calling task, or
 *
 * * receive events.
 *
 * To **get the pending events** use the constant #RTEMS_PENDING_EVENTS for the
 * ``event_in`` parameter.  The pending events are returned to the calling task
 * but the event set of the calling task is left unaltered.  The ``option_set``
 * and ``ticks`` parameters are ignored in this case.  The directive returns
 * immediately and does not block.
 *
 * To **receive events** you have to define an input event condition and some
 * options.
 *
 * The **option set** specified in ``option_set`` is built through a *bitwise
 * or* of the option constants described below.  Not all combinations of
 * options are allowed.  Some options are mutually exclusive.  If mutually
 * exclusive options are combined, the behaviour is undefined.  Options not
 * mentioned below are not evaluated by this directive and have no effect.
 * Default options can be selected by using the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_OPTIONS
 * constant.  The option set defines
 *
 * * if the calling task will wait or poll for the events, and
 *
 * * if the calling task wants to receive all or any of the input events.
 *
 * The calling task can **wait** or **poll** for the events.
 *
 * * **Waiting** for events is the default and can be emphasized through the
 *   use of the #RTEMS_WAIT option.  The ``ticks`` parameter defines how long
 *   the calling task is willing to wait.  Use #RTEMS_NO_TIMEOUT to wait
 *   potentially forever, otherwise set a timeout interval in clock ticks.
 *
 * * Not waiting for events (**polling**) is selected by the #RTEMS_NO_WAIT
 *   option.  If this option is defined, then the ``ticks`` parameter is
 *   ignored.
 *
 * The calling task can receive **all** or **any** of the input events
 * specified in ``event_in``.
 *
 * * Receiving **all** input events is the default and can be emphasized
 *   through the use of the #RTEMS_EVENT_ALL option.
 *
 * * Receiving **any** of the input events is selected by the #RTEMS_EVENT_ANY
 *   option.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL The requested operation was successful.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``event_out`` parameter was NULL.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_UNSATISFIED The events of interest were not immediately
 *   available.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_TIMEOUT The events of interest were not available within the
 *   specified timeout interval.
 *
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * This directive only affects the events specified in ``event_in``. Any
 * pending events that do not correspond to any of the events specified in
 * ``event_in`` will be left pending.
 *
 * To receive all events use the event set constant #RTEMS_ALL_EVENTS for the
 * ``event_in`` parameter.  Do not confuse this event set constant with the
 * directive option #RTEMS_EVENT_ALL.
 *
 * A task can **receive all of the pending events** by calling the directive
 * with a value of #RTEMS_ALL_EVENTS for the ``event_in`` parameter and the
 * bitwise or of the #RTEMS_NO_WAIT and #RTEMS_EVENT_ANY options for the
 * ``option_set`` parameter.  The pending events are returned and the event set
 * of the task is cleared.  If no events are pending then the
 * ::RTEMS_UNSATISFIED status code will be returned.
