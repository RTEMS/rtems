 *
 * This directive creates a message queue which resides on the local node.  The
 * message queue has the user-defined object name specified in ``name``.
 * Memory is allocated from the RTEMS Workspace for the count of messages
 * specified in ``count``, each of ``max_message_size`` bytes in length.  The
 * assigned object identifier is returned in ``id``.  This identifier is used
 * to access the message queue with other message queue related directives.
 *
 * The **attribute set** specified in ``attribute_set`` is built through a
 * *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
 * combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
 * exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
 * undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
 * directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
 * the #RTEMS_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES constant.  The attribute set defines
 *
 * * the scope of the message queue: #RTEMS_LOCAL (default) or #RTEMS_GLOBAL
 *   and
 *
 * * the task wait queue discipline used by the message queue: #RTEMS_FIFO
 *   (default) or #RTEMS_PRIORITY.
 *
 * The message queue has a local or global **scope** in a multiprocessing
 * network (this attribute does not refer to SMP systems).  The scope is
 * selected by the mutually exclusive #RTEMS_LOCAL and #RTEMS_GLOBAL
 * attributes.
 *
 * * A **local scope** is the default and can be emphasized through the use of
 *   the #RTEMS_LOCAL attribute.  A local message queue can be only used by the
 *   node which created it.
 *
 * * A **global scope** is established if the #RTEMS_GLOBAL attribute is set.
 *   Setting the global attribute in a single node system has no effect.
 *
 * The **task wait queue discipline** is selected by the mutually exclusive
 * #RTEMS_FIFO and #RTEMS_PRIORITY attributes. The discipline defines the order
 * in which tasks wait for a message to receive on a currently empty message
 * queue.
 *
 * * The **FIFO discipline** is the default and can be emphasized through use
 *   of the #RTEMS_FIFO attribute.

 *
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * For message queues with a global scope, the maximum message size is
 * effectively limited to the longest message which the MPCI is capable of
 * transmitting.
 *
 * For control and maintenance of the message queue, RTEMS allocates a QCB from
 * the local QCB free pool and initializes it.
 *
 * The QCB for a global message queue is allocated on the local node.  Message
 * queues should not be made global unless remote tasks must interact with the
 * message queue.  This is to avoid the system overhead incurred by the
 * creation of a global message queue.  When a global message queue is created,
 * the message queue's name and identifier must be transmitted to every node in
 * the system for insertion in the local copy of the global object table.

 * * **Trying to receive** a message from the queue is selected by the
 *   #RTEMS_NO_WAIT option.  If this option is defined, then the ``timeout``
 *   parameter is ignored.  When a message from the queue cannot be immediately
 *   received, then the ::RTEMS_UNSATISFIED status is returned.
 *
 * With either #RTEMS_WAIT or #RTEMS_NO_WAIT if there is at least one message
 * in the queue, then it is copied to the buffer, the size is set to return the
 * length of the message in bytes, and this directive returns immediately with
 * the ::RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL status code.  The buffer has to be big enough to
 * receive a message of the maximum length with respect to this message queue.
 *
 * If the calling task chooses to return immediately and the queue is empty,
 * then the directive returns immediately with the ::RTEMS_UNSATISFIED status
 * code.  If the calling task chooses to wait at the message queue and the
 * queue is empty, then the calling task is placed on the message wait queue
 * and blocked.  If the queue was created with the #RTEMS_PRIORITY option
 * specified, then the calling task is inserted into the wait queue according
 * to its priority.  But, if the queue was created with the #RTEMS_FIFO option
 * specified, then the calling task is placed at the rear of the wait queue.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL The requested operation was successful.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ID There was no queue associated with the identifier
 *   specified by ``id``.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``buffer`` parameter was NULL.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS The ``size`` parameter was NULL.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_UNSATISFIED The queue was empty.
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_TIMEOUT The timeout happened while the calling task was
 *   waiting to receive a message
 *
 * @retval ::RTEMS_OBJECT_WAS_DELETED The queue was deleted while the calling
 *   task was waiting to receive a message.

 * The following constraints apply to this directive:
 *
 * - When a local queue is accessed and the #RTEMS_NO_WAIT option is set, the
 *   directive may be called from within interrupt context.
 *
 * - The directive may be called from within task context.
 *
 * - When the request cannot be immediately satisfied and the #RTEMS_WAIT
 *   option is set, the calling task blocks at some point during the directive
 *   call.
 *
 * - The timeout functionality of the directive requires a clock tick.
 *
 * - When the directive operates on a remote object, the directive sends a
 *   message to the remote node and waits for a reply.  This will preempt the
 *   calling task.
