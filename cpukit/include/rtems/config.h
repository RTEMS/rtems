/**
 * @defgroup RTEMSAPIConfig Application Configuration Information
 *
 * @ingroup RTEMSAPI
 *
 * @brief The application configuration information group provides an API to
 *   get the configuration of an application.
 *
 * RTEMS must be configured for an application.  This configuration encompasses
 * a variety of information including the length of each clock tick, the
 * maximum number of each information RTEMS object that can be created, the
 * application initialization tasks, the task scheduling algorithm to be used,
 * and the device drivers in the application.
 *
 * Although this information is contained in data structures that are used by
 * RTEMS at system initialization time, the data structures themselves must not
 * be generated by hand. RTEMS provides a set of macros system which provides a
 * simple standard mechanism to automate the generation of these structures.
 *
 * The RTEMS header file `<rtems/confdefs.h>` is at the core of the automatic
 * generation of system configuration. It is based on the idea of setting
 * macros which define configuration parameters of interest to the application
 * and defaulting or calculating all others. This variety of macros can
 * automatically produce all of the configuration data required for an RTEMS
 * application.  The term `confdefs` is shorthand for a *Configuration
 * Defaults*.
 *
 * As a general rule, application developers only specify values for the
 * configuration parameters of interest to them. They define what resources or
 * features they require. In most cases, when a parameter is not specified, it
 * defaults to zero (0) instances, a standards compliant value, or disabled as
 * appropriate. For example, by default there will be 256 task priority levels
 * but this can be lowered by the application. This number of priority levels
 * is required to be compliant with the RTEID/ORKID standards upon which the
 * Classic API is based. There are similar cases where the default is selected
 * to be compliant with the POSIX standard.
 *
 * For each configuration parameter in the configuration tables, the macro
 * corresponding to that field is discussed. The RTEMS Maintainers expect that
 * all systems can be easily configured using the `<rtems/confdefs.h>`
 * mechanism and that using this mechanism will avoid internal RTEMS
 * configuration changes impacting applications.
 *
 * Some application configuration settings and other system parameters can be
 * queried by the application.
