 *  Year 2K Notes:
 *
 *  This chip only uses a two digit field to store the year.  This
 *  code uses the RTEMS Epoch as a pivot year.  This lets us map the
 *  two digit year field as follows:
 *
 *    + two digit years 0-87 are mapped to 2000-2087.
 *    + two digit years 88-99 are mapped to 1988-1999.
 *
 *  This is less than the time span supported by RTEMS.
