	 *       The 8540's openpic supports 12 core-external
	 *       and 23 core-internal (both of these groups
	 *       are external to the PIC, i.e., 'pic-external')
	 *       interrupts but between the corresponding
	 *       banks of vector/priority registers there is
	 *       a gap leaving space for 4 (unsupported) irqs.
	 *       The driver, not knowing of this gap, would
	 *       initialize the 12 core-external sources
	 *       followed by 4 unsupported sources and 19
	 *       core-internal sources thus leaving the last
	 *       four core-internal sources uninitialized.
	 *       Luckily, the feature register reports
	 *       too many sources:
	 *          - the 4 IPI plus 4 timer plus 4 messaging
	 *            sources are included with the count
	 *          - there are unused core-internal sources 24..32
	 *            which are also supported by the pic
	 *       bringing the reported number of sources to
	 *       a count of 56 (12+32+4+4+4) which is enough
	 *       so that all pic-external sources are covered
	 *       and initialized.
	 *
	 *       NOTE: All core-internal sources are active-high.
	 *             The manual says that setting the polarity
	 *             to 'low/0' will disable the interrupt but
	 *             I found this not to be true: on the device
	 *             I tested the interrupt was asserted hard.
