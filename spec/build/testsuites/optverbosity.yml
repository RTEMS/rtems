  Sets the test verbosity of the RTEMS Test Framework.  Valid values are
  "Verbose", "Normal", and "Quiet".  For normal test runs you can use a
  verbosity of "Normal".  If you need a more detailed output, then you can set
  it to "Verbose".  For example, in case a regression occurred.  Reducing the
  verbosity level can significantly reduce the test duration especially on
  targets with a slow serial output device.  All verbosity levels produce
  enough output to notice failed test cases.  In particular, the begin and end
  of test information is not affected by the verbosity level.
