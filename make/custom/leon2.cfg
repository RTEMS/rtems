#  NDEBUG (C library)
#     if defined asserts do not generate code.  This is commonly used 
#     as a command line option.
#
#  RTEMS_TEST_NO_PAUSE (RTEMS tests)
#     do not pause between screens of output in the rtems tests
#
#  NO_TABLE_MOVE (SPARC PORT)
#     do not have a second trap table -- use the BSP's
#
#  RTEMS_DEBUG (RTEMS)
#     If defined, debug checks in RTEMS and support library code are enabled.
#
#  CONSOLE_USE_POLLED     (leon_bsp)
#  CONSOLE_USE_INTERRUPTS (leon_bsp)
#     The erc32 console driver can operate in either polled or interrupt mode.
#     Under the simulator (especially when FAST_UART is defined), polled seems
#     to operate better.  It is common for a task to print a line (like the
#     end of test message) and then exit.  In this case, the program returns
#     control to the simulator command line before the program has even queued
#     the output to the uart.  Thus sis has no chance of getting the data out.
#
#  SIMSPARC_FAST_IDLE (leon_bsp)
#     If defined, speed up the clock ticks while the idle task is running so
#     time spent in the idle task is minimized.  This significantly reduces
#     the wall time required to execute the RTEMS test suites.
#
#  CPU_U32_FIX (all)
#     Needed to align received TCP/IP packets since SPARC does not 
#     support unaligned memory access.
