#  PPC_ABI (PowerPC)
#     This defines the calling convention (Application Binary Interface)
#     used in this configuration.  EABI is the only one supported.
#     This BSP was initially developed using the PowerOpen ABI.
#
#  PPC_ASM (PowerPC)
#     This defines the assembly language format used in this configuration.
#     ELF is the only one supported.

#  This contains the compiler options necessary to select the CPU model
#  and (hopefully) optimize for it.
