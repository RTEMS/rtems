@chapter Interrupt Manager

@section Introduction

Any real-time executive must provide a mechanism for
quick response to externally generated interrupts to satisfy the
critical time constraints of the application.  The interrupt
manager provides this mechanism for RTEMS.  This manager permits
quick interrupt response times by providing the critical ability
to alter task execution which allows a task to be preempted upon
exit from an ISR.  The interrupt manager includes the following
directive:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_catch} - Establish an ISR
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_disable} - Disable Interrupts
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_enable} - Enable Interrupts
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_flash} - Flash Interrupt
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_lock_initialize} - Initialize an ISR Lock
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_lock_acquire} - Acquire an ISR Lock
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_lock_release} - Release an ISR Lock
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_lock_acquire_isr} - Acquire an ISR Lock from ISR
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_lock_release_isr} - Release an ISR Lock from ISR
@item @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_is_in_progress} - Is an ISR in Progress
@end itemize

@section Background

@subsection Processing an Interrupt

@cindex interrupt processing

The interrupt manager allows the application to
connect a function to a hardware interrupt vector.  When an
interrupt occurs, the processor will automatically vector to
RTEMS.  RTEMS saves and restores all registers which are not
preserved by the normal @value{LANGUAGE} calling convention
for the target
processor and invokes the user's ISR.  The user's ISR is
responsible for processing the interrupt, clearing the interrupt
if necessary, and device specific manipulation.

@findex rtems_vector_number

The @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_catch}
directive connects a procedure to
an interrupt vector.  The vector number is managed using
the @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}vector_number} data type.

The interrupt service routine is assumed
to abide by these conventions and have a prototype similar to
the following:

@ifset is-C
@findex rtems_isr

@example
rtems_isr user_isr(
  rtems_vector_number vector
);
@end example
@end ifset

@ifset is-Ada
@example
NOT SUPPORTED FROM Ada BINDING
@end example
@end ifset

The vector number argument is provided by RTEMS to
allow the application to identify the interrupt source.  This
could be used to allow a single routine to service interrupts
from multiple instances of the same device.  For example, a
single routine could service interrupts from multiple serial
ports and use the vector number to identify which port requires
servicing.

To minimize the masking of lower or equal priority
level interrupts, the ISR should perform the minimum actions
required to service the interrupt.  Other non-essential actions
should be handled by application tasks.  Once the user's ISR has
completed, it returns control to the RTEMS interrupt manager
which will perform task dispatching and restore the registers
saved before the ISR was invoked.

The RTEMS interrupt manager guarantees that proper
task scheduling and dispatching are performed at the conclusion
of an ISR.  A system call made by the ISR may have readied a
task of higher priority than the interrupted task.  Therefore,
when the ISR completes, the postponed dispatch processing must
be performed.  No dispatch processing is performed as part of
directives which have been invoked by an ISR.

Applications must adhere to the following rule if
proper task scheduling and dispatching is to be performed:

@itemize @b{ }

@item @b{The interrupt manager must be used for all ISRs which
may be interrupted by the highest priority ISR which invokes an
RTEMS directive.}

@end itemize

Consider a processor which allows a numerically low
interrupt level to interrupt a numerically greater interrupt
level.  In this example, if an RTEMS directive is used in a
level 4 ISR, then all ISRs which execute at levels 0 through 4
must use the interrupt manager.

Interrupts are nested whenever an interrupt occurs
during the execution of another ISR.  RTEMS supports efficient
interrupt nesting by allowing the nested ISRs to terminate
without performing any dispatch processing.  Only when the
outermost ISR terminates will the postponed dispatching occur.

@subsection RTEMS Interrupt Levels

@cindex interrupt levels

Many processors support multiple interrupt levels or
priorities.  The exact number of interrupt levels is processor
dependent.  RTEMS internally supports 256 interrupt levels which
are mapped to the processor's interrupt levels.  For specific
information on the mapping between RTEMS and the target
processor's interrupt levels, refer to the Interrupt Processing
chapter of the Applications Supplement document for a specific
target processor.

@subsection Disabling of Interrupts by RTEMS

@cindex disabling interrupts

During the execution of directive calls, critical
sections of code may be executed.  When these sections are
encountered, RTEMS disables all maskable interrupts before the
execution of the section and restores them to the previous level
upon completion of the section.  RTEMS has been optimized to
ensure that interrupts are disabled for a minimum length of
time.  The maximum length of time interrupts are disabled by
RTEMS is processor dependent and is detailed in the Timing
Specification chapter of the Applications Supplement document
for a specific target processor.

Non-maskable interrupts (NMI) cannot be disabled, and
ISRs which execute at this level MUST NEVER issue RTEMS system
calls.  If a directive is invoked, unpredictable results may
occur due to the inability of RTEMS to protect its critical
sections.  However, ISRs that make no system calls may safely
execute as non-maskable interrupts.

@section Operations

@subsection Establishing an ISR

The @code{@value{DIRPREFIX}interrupt_catch}
directive establishes an ISR for
the system.  The address of the ISR and its associated CPU
vector number are specified to this directive.  This directive
installs the RTEMS interrupt wrapper in the processor's
Interrupt Vector Table and the address of the user's ISR in the
RTEMS' Vector Table.  This directive returns the previous
contents of the specified vector in the RTEMS' Vector Table.

@subsection Directives Allowed from an ISR

Using the interrupt manager ensures that RTEMS knows
when a directive is being called from an ISR.  The ISR may then
use system calls to synchronize itself with an application task.
The synchronization may involve messages, events or signals
being passed by the ISR to the desired task.  Directives invoked
by an ISR must operate only on objects which reside on the local
node.  The following is a list of RTEMS system calls that may be
made from an ISR:

@itemize @bullet
@item Task Management

Although it is acceptable to operate on the RTEMS_SELF task (e.g.
the currently executing task), while in an ISR, this will refer
to the interrupted task.  Most of the time, it is an application
implementation error to use RTEMS_SELF from an ISR.
