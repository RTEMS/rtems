@c === Introduction ===

@section Introduction

RTEMS must be configured for an application.  This configuration
encompasses a variety of information including the length of each clock
tick, the maximum number of each information RTEMS object that can
be created, the application initialization tasks, the task scheduling
algorithm to be used, and the device drivers in the application.

Although this information is contained in data structures that are used
by RTEMS at system initialization time, the data structures themselves
should only rarely to be generated by hand. RTEMS provides a set of
macros system which provides a simple standard mechanism to automate
the generation of these structures.

@ifset is-Ada
System configuration is ALWAYS done from C.  When developing
an Ada application, the user is responsible for creating at
least one C file which contains the Ada run-time initialization
and the RTEMS System Configuration.  There is no Ada binding
for RTEMS System Configuration information.  Thus all examples
and data structures shown in this chapter are in C.
@end ifset

@cindex confdefs.h
@findex confdefs.h
@cindex <rtems/confdefs.h>
@findex <rtems/confdefs.h>

The RTEMS header file @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} is at the core of the
automatic generation of system configuration. It is based on the idea
of setting macros which define configuration parameters of interest to
the application and defaulting or calculating all others. This variety
of macros can automatically produce all of the configuration data
required for an RTEMS application.

Trivia: @code{confdefs} is shorthand for a @b{Configuration Defaults}.

As a general rule, application developers only specify values
for the configuration parameters of interest to them. They define what
resources or features they require. In most cases, when a parameter is
not specified, it defaults to zero (0) instances, a standards compliant
value, or disabled as appropriate. For example, by default there will be
256 task priority levels but this can be lowered by the application. This
number of priority levels is required to be compliant with the RTEID/ORKID
standards upon which the Classic API is based. There are similar cases
where the default is selected to be compliant with with the POSIX standard.

For each configuration parameter in the configuration tables, the macro
corresponding to that field is discussed. The RTEMS Maintainers
expect that all systems can be easily configured using the
@code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} mechanism and that using this mechanism will
avoid internal RTEMS configuration changes impacting applications.

@c
@c === Philosophy ===
@c
@section Default Value Selection Philosophy

The user should be aware that the defaults are intentionally set as
low as possible.  By default, no application resources are configured.
The @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} file ensures that at least one application
task or thread is configured and that at least one of the initialization
task/thread tables is configured.

@c
@c === Sizing the RTEMS Workspace ===
@c
@section Sizing the RTEMS Workspace

The RTEMS Workspace is a user-specified block of memory reserved for
use by RTEMS.  The application should NOT modify this memory.  This area
consists primarily of the RTEMS data structures whose exact size depends
upon the values specified in the Configuration Table.  In addition,
task stacks and floating point context areas are dynamically allocated
from the RTEMS Workspace.

The @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} mechanism calculates the size of the RTEMS
Workspace automatically.  It assumes that all tasks are floating point and
that all will be allocated the minimum stack space.  This calculation
includes the amount of memory that will be allocated for internal use
by RTEMS. The automatic calculation may underestimate the workspace
size truly needed by the application, in which case one can use the
@code{CONFIGURE_MEMORY_OVERHEAD} macro to add a value to the estimate. See
@ref{Configuring a System Specify Memory Overhead} for more details.

The memory area for the RTEMS Workspace is determined by the BSP.  In case the
RTEMS Workspace is too large for the available memory, then a fatal run-time
error occurs and the system terminates.

The file @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} will calculate the value of the
@code{work_space_size} parameter of the Configuration Table. There
are many parameters the application developer can specify to
help @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} in its calculations.  Correctly
specifying the application requirements via parameters such as
@code{CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS} and @code{CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TASKS}
is critical for production software.

For each class of objects, the allocation can operate in one of two ways.
The default way has an ceiling on the maximum number of object instances
which can concurrently exist in the system. Memory for all instances of
that object class is reserved at system initialization.  The second
way allocates memory for an initial number of objects and increases the
current allocation by a fixed increment when required. Both ways allocate
space from inside the RTEMS Workspace.

See @ref{Configuring a System Unlimited Objects} for more details about
the second way, which allows for dynamic allocation of objects and
therefore does not provide determinism.  This mode is useful mostly for
when the number of objects cannot be determined ahead of time or when
porting software for which you do not know the object requirements.

The space needed for stacks and for RTEMS objects will vary from
one version of RTEMS and from one target processor to another.
Therefore it is safest to use @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} and specify
your application's requirements in terms of the numbers of objects and
multiples of @code{RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE}, as far as is possible. The
automatic estimates of space required will in general change when:

@itemize @bullet
@item a configuration parameter is changed,
@item task or interrupt stack sizes change,
@item the floating point attribute of a task changes,
@item task floating point attribute is altered,
@item RTEMS is upgraded, or
@item the target processor is changed.
@end itemize

Failure to provide enough space in the RTEMS Workspace may result in fatal
run-time errors terminating the system.

@c
@c === Potential Issues ===
@c
@section Potential Issues with RTEMS Workspace Size Estimation

The @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} file estimates the amount of memory
required for the RTEMS Workspace.  This estimate is only as accurate
as the information given to @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} and may be either
too high or too low for a variety of reasons.  Some of the reasons that
@code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} may reserve too much memory for RTEMS are:

@itemize @bullet
@item All tasks/threads are assumed to be floating point.
@end itemize

Conversely, there are many more reasons that the resource estimate could be
too low:

@itemize @bullet
@item Task/thread stacks greater than minimum size must be
accounted for explicitly by developer.

@item Memory for messages is not included.

@item Device driver requirements are not included.

@item Network stack requirements are not included.

@item Requirements for add-on libraries are not included.
@end itemize

In general, @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} is very accurate when given enough
information.  However, it is quite easy to use a library and forget to
account for its resources.

@c
@c === Configuration Example ===
@c
@section Configuration Example

In the following example, the configuration information for a system
with a single message queue, four (4) tasks, and a timeslice of
fifty (50) milliseconds is as follows:

@example
@group
#include <bsp.h>

#define CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER
#define CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER

#define CONFIGURE_MICROSECONDS_PER_TICK   1000 /* 1 millisecond */
#define CONFIGURE_TICKS_PER_TIMESLICE       50 /* 50 milliseconds */

#define CONFIGURE_RTEMS_INIT_TASKS_TABLE

#define CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TASKS 4
#define CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_MESSAGE_QUEUES 1

#define CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MEMORY \
  CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFERS_FOR_QUEUE(20, sizeof(struct USER_MESSAGE))

#define CONFIGURE_INIT
#include <rtems/confdefs.h>
@end group
@end example

In this example, only a few configuration parameters are specified. The
impact of these are as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item The example specified @code{CONFIGURE_RTEMS_INIT_TASK_TABLE}
but did not specify any additional parameters. This results in a
configuration of an application which will begin execution of a single
initialization task named @code{Init} which is non-preemptible and at
priority one (1).

@item By specifying @code{CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER},
this application is configured to have a clock tick device
driver. Without a clock tick device driver, RTEMS has no way to know
that time is passing and will be unable to support delays and wall
time. Further configuration details about time are
provided. Per @code{CONFIGURE_MICROSECONDS_PER_TICK} and
@code{CONFIGURE_TICKS_PER_TIMESLICE}, the user specified they wanted a
clock tick to occur each millisecond, and that the length of a timeslice
would be fifty (50) milliseconds.

@item By specifying @code{CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER},
the application will include a console device driver. Although the
console device driver may support a combination of multiple serial
ports and display and keyboard combinations, it is only required to
provide a single device named @code{/dev/console}. This device will
be used for Standard Input, Output and Error I/O Streams. Thus when
@code{CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER} is specified, implicitly
three (3) file descriptors are reserved for the Standard I/O Streams and
those file descriptors are associated with @code{/dev/console} during
initialization. All console devices are expected to support the POSIX
@i{termios} interface.

@item The example above specifies via @code{CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TASKS}
that the application requires a maximum of four (4)
simultaneously existing Classic API tasks. Similarly, by specifying
@code{CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_MESSAGE_QUEUES}, there may be a maximum of only
one (1) concurrently existent Classic API message queues.

@item The most surprising configuration parameter in this example is the
use of @code{CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MEMORY}. Message buffer memory is
allocated from the RTEMS Workspace and must be accounted for. In this
example, the single message queue will have up to twenty (20) messages
of type @code{struct USER_MESSAGE}.

@item The @code{CONFIGURE_INIT} constant must be defined in order to
make @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} instantiate the configuration data
structures.  This can only be defined in one source file per
application that includes @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} or the symbol
table will be instantiated multiple times and linking errors
produced.

@end itemize

This example illustrates that parameters have default values. Among
other things, the application implicitly used the following defaults:

@itemize @bullet
@item All unspecified types of communications and synchronization objects
in the Classic and POSIX Threads API have maximums of zero (0).

@item The filesystem will be the default filesystem which is the In-Memory File
System (IMFS).

@item The application will have the default number of priority levels.

@item The minimum task stack size will be that recommended by RTEMS for
the target architecture.
@end itemize

@c
@c === Unlimited Objects ===
@c
@subsection Unlimited Objects

In real-time embedded systems the RAM is normally a limited, critical
resource and dynamic allocation is avoided as much as possible to
ensure predictable, deterministic execution times. For such cases, see
@ref{Configuring a System Sizing the RTEMS Workspace} for an overview
of how to tune the size of the workspace.  Frequently when users are
porting software to RTEMS the precise resource requirements of the
software is unknown. In these situations users do not need to control
the size of the workspace very tightly because they just want to get
the new software to run; later they can tune the workspace size as needed.

The following object classes in the Classic API can be configured in
unlimited mode:

@itemize @bullet
@item Tasks
@item Timers
@item Semaphores
@item Message Queues
@item Periods
@item Barriers
@item Partitions
@item Regions
@item Ports
@end itemize

Additionally, the following object classes from the POSIX API can be
configured in unlimited mode:

@itemize @bullet
@item Threads
@item Mutexes
@item Condition Variables
@item Keys
@item Timers
@item Message Queues
@item Message Queue Descriptors
@item Semaphores
@item Barriers
@item Read/Write Locks
@item Spinlocks
@end itemize

Due to how the POSIX object memory requirements are configured the
unlimited object support does not provide unlimited size declarations
for POSIX keys or queued signals.

Users are cautioned that using unlimited objects is not recommended for
production software unless the dynamic growth is absolutely required. It
is generally considered a safer embedded systems programming practice to
know the system limits rather than experience an out of memory error
at an arbitrary and largely unpredictable time in the field.

@c
@c === Per Object Class Unlimited Object Instances ===
@c
@subsection Per Object Class Unlimited Object Instances

@findex rtems_resource_unlimited
When the number of objects is not known ahead of time, RTEMS provides an
auto-extending mode that can be enabled individually for each object
type by using the macro @code{rtems_resource_unlimited}. This takes a value
as a parameter, and is used to set the object maximum number field in
an API Configuration table. The value is an allocation unit size. When
RTEMS is required to grow the object table it is grown by this
size. The kernel will return the object memory back to the RTEMS Workspace
when an object is destroyed. The kernel will only return an allocated
block of objects to the RTEMS Workspace if at least half the allocation
size of free objects remain allocated. RTEMS always keeps one
allocation block of objects allocated. Here is an example of using
@code{rtems_resource_unlimited}:

@example
#define CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TASKS rtems_resource_unlimited(5)
@end example

@findex rtems_resource_is_unlimited
@findex rtems_resource_maximum_per_allocation
Object maximum specifications can be evaluated with the
@code{rtems_resource_is_unlimited} and
@code{rtems_resource_maximum_per_allocation} macros.

@c
@c === Unlimited Object Instances ===
@c
@subsection Unlimited Object Instances

To ease the burden of developers who are porting new software RTEMS
also provides the capability to make all object classes listed above
operate in unlimited mode in a simple manner. The application developer
is only responsible for enabling unlimited objects and specifying the
allocation size.

@subheading NOTES:
When using unlimited objects, it is common practice to also specify
@code{CONFIGURE_UNIFIED_WORK_AREAS} so the system operates with a single

@subheading NOTES:
By allowing users to declare all resources as being unlimited
the user can avoid identifying and limiting the resources used.
@code{CONFIGURE_OBJECTS_UNLIMITED} does not support varying the allocation
sizes for different objects; users who want that much control can define
the @code{rtems_resource_unlimited} macros themselves.

@subheading NOTES:
This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode.

The calculations for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace
for tasks assume that each task has a minimum stack size and
has floating point support enabled.  The configuration parameter
@code{CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS} is used to specify task stack
requirements @b{ABOVE} the minimum size required.  See
@ref{Configuring a System Reserve Task/Thread Stack Memory Above Minimum}
for more information about @code{CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS}.

The maximumm number of POSIX threads is specified by
@code{CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_POSIX_THREADS}.
@c XXX - Add xref to CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_POSIX_THREADS.

A future enhancement to @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} could be to eliminate

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
When defined, the C Program Heap and the RTEMS Workspace will be one pool
of memory.

When not defined, there will be separate memory pools for the RTEMS
Workspace and C Program Heap.

@subheading NOTES:
Having separate pools does have some advantages in the event a task blows
a stack or writes outside its memory area. However, in low memory systems
the overhead of the two pools plus the potential for unused memory in
either pool is very undesirable.

In high memory environments, this is desirable when you want to use the
RTEMS "unlimited" objects option.  You will be able to create objects
until you run out of all available memory rather then just until you
run out of RTEMS Workspace.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is not defined by default. When not defined,
the clock tick quantum is configured to be 10,000
microseconds which is ten (10) milliseconds.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
This constant is  used to specify the length of time between clock ticks.

When the clock tick quantum value is too low, the system will spend so
much time processing clock ticks that it does not have processing time
available to perform application work. In this case, the system will
become unresponsive.

The lowest practical time quantum varies widely based upon the speed
of the target hardware and the architectural overhead associated with
interrupts. In general terms, you do not want to configure it lower than
is needed for the application.

The clock tick quantum should be selected such that it all blocking and
delay times in the application are evenly divisible by it. Otherwise,
rounding errors will be introduced which may negatively impact the
application.

@subheading NOTES:
This configuration parameter has no impact if the Clock Tick Device

valid values are 3, 7, 31, 63, 127, and 255.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
The default value is 255, because RTEMS must support 256 priority levels to be
compliant with various standards. These priorities range from zero (0) to 255.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
This configuration parameter specified the maximum numeric priority
of any task in the system and one less that the number of priority levels
in the system.

Reducing the number of priorities in the system reduces the amount of
memory allocated from the RTEMS Workspace.

@subheading NOTES:
The numerically greatest priority is the logically lowest priority in
the system and will thus be used by the IDLE task.

Priority zero (0) is reserved for internal use by RTEMS and is not
available to applications.

With some schedulers, reducing the number of priorities can reduce the
amount of memory used by the scheduler. For example, the Deterministic
Priority Scheduler (DPS) used by default uses three pointers of storage
per priority level. Reducing the number of priorities from 256 levels
to sixteen (16) can reduce memory usage by about three (3) kilobytes.

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
The configuration parameter is set to the number of bytes the application
wants the minimum stack size to be for every task or thread in the system.

Adjusting this parameter should be done with caution. Examining the actual
usage using the Stack Checker Usage Reporting facility is recommended.

@subheading NOTES:
This parameter can be used to lower the minimum from that
recommended. This can be used in low memory systems to reduce memory
consumption for stacks. However, this must be done with caution as it
could increase the possibility of a blown task stack.

This parameter can be used to increase the minimum from that
recommended. This can be used in higher memory systems to reduce the
risk of stack overflow without performing analysis on actual consumption.

@subheading NOTES:
In some BSPs, changing this constant does NOT change the

@item DATA TYPE:
Unsigned integer (@code{size_t}).

@item RANGE:
Positive.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
The default value is None.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
This is a helper macro which is used to assist in computing the total
amount of memory required for message buffers.  Each message queue will
have its own configuration with maximum message size and maximum number
of pending messages.

The interface for this macro is as follows:

@example
CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFERS_FOR_QUEUE(max_messages, size_per)
@end example

Where @code{max_messages} is the maximum number of pending messages
and @code{size_per} is the size in bytes of the user message.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
This macro is set to the number of bytes the application requires to be
reserved for pending Classic API Message Queue buffers.

@subheading NOTES:
The following illustrates how the help macro
@code{CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFERS_FOR_QUEUE} can be used to assist in
calculating the message buffer memory required.  In this example, there
are two message queues used in this application.  The first message
queue has maximum of 24 pending messages with the message structure
defined by the type @code{one_message_type}.  The other message queue
has maximum of 500 pending messages with the message structure defined
by the type @code{other_message_type}.

@example
@group
#define CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MEMORY \
 (CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFERS_FOR_QUEUE( \
    24, sizeof(one_message_type) + \
  CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFERS_FOR_QUEUE( \

@c === Scheduler Algorithm Configuration ===
@c
@section Scheduler Algorithm Configuration

This section defines the configuration parameters related to selecting a
scheduling algorithm for an application.  For the schedulers built into
RTEMS, the configuration is straightforward.  All that is required is
to define the configuration macro which specifies which scheduler you
want for in your application.  The currently available schedulers are:

The pluggable scheduler interface also enables the user to provide their
own scheduling algorithm.  If you choose to do this, you must define
multiple configuration macros.

Boolean feature macro.

@item RANGE:
Defined or undefined.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is defined by default.
This is the default scheduler and specifying this
configuration parameter is redundant.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
The Deterministic Priority Scheduler is the default scheduler in RTEMS
for single core applications and is designed for predictable performance
under the highest loads.  It can block or unblock a thread in a constant
amount of time.  This scheduler requires a variable amount of memory
based upon the number of priorities configured in the system.

@subheading NOTES:
This scheduler may be explicitly selected by defining
@code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY} although this is equivalent to the
default behavior.

@c
@c === CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_SIMPLE ===

@item CONSTANT:
@code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_SIMPLE}

@item DATA TYPE:
Boolean feature macro.

@item RANGE:
Defined or undefined.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is not defined by default.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
When defined, the Simple Priority Scheduler is used at the thread
scheduling algorithm. This is an alternative scheduler in RTEMS.
It is designed to provide the same task scheduling behaviour as the
Deterministic Priority Scheduler while being simpler in implementation
and uses less memory for data management.  It maintains a single sorted
list of all ready threads.  Thus blocking or unblocking a thread is not
a constant time operation with this scheduler.

This scheduler may be explicitly selected by defining
@code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_SIMPLE}.

@subheading NOTES:
This scheduler is appropriate for use in small systems where RAM is limited.

@item DATA TYPE:
Boolean feature macro.

@item RANGE:
Defined or undefined.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is not defined by default.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
The Earliest Deadline First Scheduler (EDF) is an alternative scheduler in
RTEMS for single core applications. The EDF schedules tasks with dynamic
priorities equal to deadlines. The deadlines are declared using only
Rate Monotonic manager which handles periodic behavior.  Period is always
equal to deadline. If a task does not have any deadline declared or the
deadline is cancelled, the task is considered a background task which is
scheduled in case no deadline-driven tasks are ready to run.  Moreover,
multiple background tasks are scheduled according their priority assigned
upon initialization. All ready tasks reside in a single ready queue.

This scheduler may be explicitly selected by defining
@code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_EDF}.

@subheading NOTES:
None.

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
The Constant Bandwidth Server Scheduler (CBS) is an alternative scheduler
in RTEMS for single core applications. The CBS is a budget aware extension
of EDF scheduler. The goal of this scheduler is to ensure temporal
isolation of tasks. The CBS is equipped with a set of additional rules
and provides with an extensive API.

This scheduler may be explicitly selected by defining
@code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_CBS}.

@item DATA TYPE:
Boolean feature macro.

@item RANGE:
Defined or undefined.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is not defined by default.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
The Simple SMP Priority Scheduler is derived from the Simple Priority
Scheduler but is capable of scheduling threads across multiple cores.
It is designed to provide the same task scheduling behaviour as the
Deterministic Priority Scheduler while distributing threads across
multiple cores.  Being based upon the Simple Priority Scheduler, it also
maintains a single sorted list of all ready threads.  Thus blocking or
unblocking a thread is not a constant time operation with this scheduler.

In addition, when allocating threads to cores, the algorithm is not
constant time. This algorithm was not designed with efficiency as a
primary design goal.  Its primary design goal was to provide an SMP-aware
scheduling algorithm that is simple to understand.

In a configuration with SMP enabled at configure time, it may be
explicitly selected by defining @code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_SIMPLE_SMP}.

@subheading NOTES:
This scheduler is only available when RTEMS is configured with SMP
support enabled.

This scheduler is currently the default in SMP configurations and is
only selected when @code{CONFIGURE_SMP_APPLICATION} is defined.

Undefined or scheduler entry set

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is not defined by default.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
RTEMS allows the application to provide its own task/thread
scheduling algorithm. In order to do this, one must define
@code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_USER} to indicate the application provides its
own scheduling algorithm. If @code{CONFIGURE_SCHEDULER_USER} is defined
then the following additional macros must be defined:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{CONFIGURE_MEMORY_FOR_SCHEDULER} must be defined with the
amount of memory required as a base amount for the scheduler.

@item @code{CONFIGURE_MEMORY_PER_TASK_FOR_SCHEDULER(_tasks)} must be
defined as a formula which computes the amount of memory required based
upon the number of tasks configured.

@end itemize

@subheading NOTES:
At this time, the mechanics and requirements for writing a
new scheduler are evolving and not fully documented.  It is
recommended that you look at the existing Deterministic Priority
Scheduler in @code{cpukit/score/src/schedulerpriority*.c} for
guidance.  For guidance on the configuration macros, please examine
@code{cpukit/sapi/include/confdefs.h} for how these are defined for the
Deterministic Priority Scheduler.

This is a configuration parameter which is very unlikely to be used by
an application. If you find yourself wanting to use it in an application,
please reconsider and discuss this on the RTEMS Users mailing list.

@section Ada Tasks

This section defines the system configuration parameters supported
by @code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} related to configuring RTEMS to support
a task using Ada tasking with GNAT/RTEMS.

These configuration parameters are only available when RTEMS is built with
the @code{--enable-ada} configure option and the application specifies
@code{CONFIGURE_GNAT_RTEMS}.

Additionally RTEMS includes an Ada language binding to the Classic
API which has a test suite. This test suite is enabled only when
@code{--enable-tests} and @code{--enable-expada} are specified on the
configure command.

@subsection Specify Application Includes Ada Code

@findex CONFIGURE_GNAT_RTEMS

@table @b
@item CONSTANT:
@code{CONFIGURE_GNAT_RTEMS}

@item DATA TYPE:
Boolean feature macro.

@item RANGE:
Defined or undefined.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
This is not defined by default.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
@code{CONFIGURE_GNAT_RTEMS} is defined to inform RTEMS that the GNAT
Ada run-time is to be used by the application.

@subheading NOTES:
This configuration parameter is critical as it makes
@code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} configure the resources (POSIX API Threads,
Mutexes, Condition Variables, and Keys) used implicitly by the GNAT
run-time.

@item DATA TYPE:
Unsigned integer (@code{uint32_t}).

@item RANGE:
Undefined or positive.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
If @code{CONFIGURE_GNAT_RTEMS} is defined, then the
default value is 20, otherwise the default value is 0.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
@code{CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_ADA_TASKS} is the number of Ada tasks that can
be concurrently active in the system.

@subheading NOTES:
None.

@item DATA TYPE:
Unsigned integer (@code{uint32_t}).

@item RANGE:
Zero or positive.

@item DEFAULT VALUE:
The default value is 0.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:
@code{CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_FAKE_ADA_TASKS} is the number of @i{fake} Ada tasks
that can be concurrently active in the system.  A @i{fake} Ada task is
a non-Ada task that makes calls back into Ada code and thus implicitly
uses the Ada run-time.

@subheading NOTES:
None.

@section Configuration Data Structures

It is recommended that applications be configured using
@code{<rtems/confdefs.h>} as it is simpler and insulates applications
from changes in the underlying data structures.  However, it is sometimes
important to understand the data structures that are automatically filled
in by the configuration parameters.  This section describes the primary
configuration data structures.

If the user wishes to see the details of a particular data structure,
they are are advised to look at the source code. After all, that is one
of the advantages of RTEMS.
