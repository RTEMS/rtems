GDB 4.17 is a source-level symbolic debugger for RTEMS environment.
This version is an extension of GNU GDB version 4.17, adapted for the debugging
of RTEMS applications in a heterogeneous host-target environment.

This paper documents @b{only} the RTEMS/GDB extensions to GNU
GDB 4.17, as well as its use in the RTEMS environment. The reader is assumed
to be familiar with GNU GDB.

The RTEMS project would like to thank Emmanuel Raguet (raguet@@crf.canon.fr)
and Eric Valette (valette@@crf.canon.fr) of the Canon Research Centre 
France S.A. for developing and documenting RTEMS/GDB and submitting it.
